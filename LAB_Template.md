# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 15/21 | Overall this is a good website from a user's perspective. There are parts that seem tedious to the user and could take some small adjustments but overall I was pleased with how it went.|
| Monster.com | 12/21 | This is a decent website for the average user, but there are multiple pieces I would fix if I was a developer. |

## 2.2 Site 1 - LinkedIn

I have already set up my account on this website, so there are no screenshots of that process.


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 | Not much thinking was required. The steps that were necessary were straight forward and easy to complete.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  1 | There always seemed to be more to do and that I was never truly finished with my profile. This could be a good thing since the website is going farther to expand my network, but did not show me how long until I was done.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |  All of the important pieces were separated easily from the less important. Areas such as work experience, volunteering, skills, etc were all suggested the user fill out. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |   3  | There is definitely a science behind the website and what they see as beneficial to the user and the businesses. The website takes in this information and puts the user on a specificed path to make their chances of getting hired greater.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 | The site did not copy many words.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  |  There was a progress bar when setting up an account and completing applications. However, as I mentioned previously, the "extra stuff" seemed to go on forever. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | The mobile application of this website is amazing.  |
| **TOTAL** |  15 | Overall, a good site.  |

## 2.3 Site 2

Adding information about myself and my work experience felt organized.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 | Not much thinking was required. The steps that were necessary were straight forward and easy to complete.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 |  More work was completed in less time that LinkedIn. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | Clear and definite areas to put specific work/education/etc.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1  | Seemed to be going in loops.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | Goes along with going in loops,   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  1 | No progress bar to measure how much longer I would be working.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1  | Not great, but not terrible.  |
| **TOTAL** | 12  | Overall a decent website from a user's perspective. There are some obvious pieces that need to be changed, but to the average person, it is sufficient.  |

## Step 3.5 Findings

Improvements: 1. More in depth information on what the user should do. Dumb it down for them. 2. Create a longer task for them to complete. 3. Asking more than one participant for their input.

Benefits: 1. The website being used was well developed and easy for the user to use. 2. The user completed the task and was able to communicate what they were thinking while doing the actions.

Statement: I beleive this was a great first usability test with an interaction I was comfortable with. This will prepare me well for what the future has in regards to usability tests. There were several factors that could have helped this test, but overall it was a success.
