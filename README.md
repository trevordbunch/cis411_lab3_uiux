# CIS 411 Lab 3: User Experience / User Interface
This is the User Experience (UX) / User Interface (UI) Lab for CIS 411: Systems Analysis and Design for [Messiah University](http://messiah.edu)

The purpose of this lab is to engage students to consider how to assess UX/UI considerations from their own perspective, how to solicit similar input from others, and apply findings into their own product designs.

# Doing the Lab

## 1. Pre-Requisites
1. GitHub account
2. Git is installed on your development machine.
3. Text editor or other integrated development environment (IDE) for modifying code.

## 2. Lab Description
Systems, products, and solutions are more than a series of feature functions and met requirements. Eventually, all computer systems produce a human interaction or a personal artifact. Thus, growing our appreciation for user experience and the user interface (even if weâ€™re not personally, artistically gifted) is foundational to our proficiency as a technology professionals.

This lab has 2 parts:
1. Evaluate two Online Job Search sites: Use Steve Krug's principles to assess two websites/apps.
2. Conduct Competitive Usability Test: Assess how well a product competitor performs in a useability test and determine the implications for your product design.

Detailed instructions are [here](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md), and you are expected to compile your findings into a labreport following this [template](labreports/LAB_Template.md).

## 3. Submissions
You are expected to create a lab report as a markdown file under the labreports directory using the **LAB_[GITHUB Handle].md** naming convention in your forked repository.  After you have reviewed your work, then you should submit a `Pull Request` to this repository with your lab report and any accompanying images/files (e.g., required diagrams).  Add the `Pull Request` URL into the courseroom LMS (Canvas) for grading.
