# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 20 | This was a site that was extremely easy to navigate and very simple to use. There were basically no problems that I ran into while navigating through the site and I think it is very effective. Everything that I was looking for was in the correct spot that made it easy to find and it was not too cluttered and hard to figure out.  |
| Indeed | 17 | This was a site that I found somewhat easy to navigate but ran into a few problems when searching for jobs. Nothing was a major inconvenince but there are aspects to the site that could be improved for a better experience. Even still, this is a site that does a pretty good job and works well |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Listing an item|
| Description / Steps | 1. The user clicks on the ```sell``` button. <br> 2. The user selects the type of item they want to sell from a list of categories <br> 3.

| Postconditions | The user will have an item listed to sell|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/)
2. Competitor 2 [Craigslist](https://harrisburg.craigslist.org)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to Facebook Marketplace  |   |
| 2 | Log in or create an account  |   |
| 3 | Find a lawn mower to purchase  |   |
| 4 | Save the listing they are interested in  |   |
| 5 | Go back to the home page  |   |
| 6 | Navigate to the listing they just saved  |   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to Facebook Marketplace  |   The user was able to navigate to facebook marketplace with no issues by simply searching "facebook marketplace" on the internet|
| 2 | Log in or create an account  |   User already had a Facebook account and simply logged in by clicking on the "log in" button and putting in their username and password|
| 3 | Find a lawn mower to purchase  |   The user searched up "lawn mower" in the search bar and when this was searched many lawn mowers that were being sold came up. The user was very easily able to scroll through the options until they found one they were interested in. To get more information about the listing they simply clicked on the image of the item.|
| 4 | Save the listing they are interested in  |   The user was easily able to find the "save" button on the page in order to save the listing that they were interested in and there were no issues in figuring out how to do this|
| 5 | Go back to the home page  |   When trying to navigate back to the home page the user had a little bit of struggle. They first were looking around for where to click and then finally settled on clicking the facebook icon. When they clicked this it took them to the main facebook home page and not the facebook marketplace homepage. After this they were able to figure out that they could get to the Facebook Marketplace homepage by clicking on one of the tabs at the top of the page.|
| 6 | Navigate to the listing they just saved  |   There was a lot of struggle when trying to navigate to the listing that they just saved. The user was looking around the page for a few minutes before they finally found out where this was. It was something that was frustrating for them and was not an easy task for them to accomplish.  |

## Step 3.5 Findings
- One improvement that could help to benifit the workflow would be to add keywords to go along with the tabs at the top of the page. Without these words and just pictures it can be hard to figure out where you are being taken.
- Another improvement that could help to benifit the workflow would be to make the saved listing button more visible and easier to find 
- Another improvement that could help to benefit the workflow would be to make who you are buying the item from more clear and easy to spot
- The search bar made it very easy to understand and search for items you are looking for
- The login process was easy to figure out and understand
- I believe that our team did well at coming up with the main tasks that are required in order to accomplish the main goal
- For next time we could add more detail to the tasks and not use as simple ones
- Overall, I had a good experience conducting the usability test and it was something that opened my eyes to how sites are used. I thought that this was a very useful exercise.
