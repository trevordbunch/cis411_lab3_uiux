# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Lockheed Martin | Score 1 | Employment oppertunities were easy to locate, and the filtering system intuitively found relavent job oppertunities based on keyword relavence. |
| Site 2 | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1 - Lockheed Martin

Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company which engages in research, design development, manufacturing, integration, and the sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. This is an employement oppertunity being evaluated in terms of finding internship oppertunities as a college student.

1. **The Website** - [Main Page](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html)

![lhm1](/assets/lhm1.png)
> The main page of Lockheed Martin is filled with current events with the company, however all relavent information in regards to jobs can be found with the 'Careers' dropdown in the navigation at the top of the page. The mix of bold and not bold makes it a little confusing since the bolded categories appear as headings, but are links on their own as well.


2. **Finding Jobs** - [College Students](lockheedmartinjobs.com/college-students?_ga=2.199724398.1368858057.1647794427-1144493713.1647794427#)

![lhm2](/assets/lhm2.png)
>This careers tab was well put together, automatic fill already had a suggested location entered into the search bar, and all that was needed was a keyword ('cyber' would be entered for relavance sake) 

3. **Job Selection** - [Available Positions](https://www.lockheedmartinjobs.com/search-jobs/cyber/Pennsylvania%2C%20US/694/1/3/6252001-6254927/40x8/-77x7/50/2)

![lhm3](/assets/lhm3.png)
>The results from the search provided 15 listings that were very relavent to the keyword either by name or description. On the right side of the page were further search filters and options.

4. **The Job Posting** - [Job Posting](https://www.lockheedmartinjobs.com/job/king-of-prussia/cyber-intern/694/25287370176)

![lhm4](/assets/lhm4.png)
> After clicking on a job, the website directs you to a page which gives an outline of the job posting, with bright yellow buttons which stay at the top as you scroll down giving you the option to apply now or save the job posting for the future.

5. **Applying** - [Apply Now](https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/home/HomeWithPreLoad?PageType=JobDetails&partnerid=25037&siteid=5014&jobid=677186&AL=1&_ga=2.199724398.1368858057.1647794427-1144493713.1647794427&pk_vid=468a5b743c84b0fc1647797079a017f5#jobDetails=677186_5014)

![lhm5](/assets/lhm5.png)

> When applying the first thing you need to do is create an account. This is quite possibly the worst looking formatting for a page possible, however the information is easily seen and understood. An account is just an email and password, does not ask for any skills or descriptions. That information would be found on the application

6. **The Application** - [Application](https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/home/HomeWithPreLoad?PageType=JobDetails&partnerid=25037&siteid=5014&jobid=677186&AL=1&_ga=2.199724398.1368858057.1647794427-1144493713.1647794427&pk_vid=468a5b743c84b0fc1647797079a017f5#Applypage)

![lhm6](/assets/lhm6.png)

>The application itself follows the same basic formatting, not filling up the whole screen and using a lot of white space. However, the simplicity of it makes it very easy to follow directions and get the application done. 



| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3  | The navigation bar was very intuitive and finding any information or places on the website was easy to follow and didn't require much brainpower.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 | The website requires minimums clicks and scrolling in order to access the relavent information.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 |  The process of finding a job posting was very clear, and pages are setup to give you one step at a time, making it very simple to follow directions and get something done. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | There is a lot of clutter throughout this website and the path was clear if you knew exactly what you were looking for. If you did not have exact filters and keywords, it wasn't as clear.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |1  |  After getting past the first two or three pages, there wasn't many words per page that weren't relavent. However, the first few pages such as the home page, the careers page, and the job listing page had paragraphs on paragraphs. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 |  Navigation was simple and easy, the only thing was some questionable bold choices in the main navigation bar. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  1 | From a mobile device getting to the job listing and application page was a little bit tougher, it was not designed to be a mobile application.  |
| **TOTAL** | 16/21  |  Overall this website was very useful for finding a career with Lockheed Martin. Compared to other companies, the website was much more intuitive and easy to workwith. My main complaint would have to be the amount of words on the main page. |

## 2.3 Site 2 - ZipRecruiter
ZipRecruiter an job search engine similar to indeed, monster, or linkedin. The application was first promoted to employers, as it was intended to be a place to link employers with good employees, but has since shifted to help people look and apply for jobs through the website. I did not think I would like the website based on the ads I had seen for it.

1. **The Website** - [Main Page](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/)

![zr1](/assets/zr1.png)
> The main page of ZipRecruiter is very clean and intuitive. In the center is an avatar with a speech bubble claiming to be a personal recruiter and a simple search bar for jobs. 


2. **Signing In** - [Sign In](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/onboard)

![zr2](/assets/zr2.png)

> After clicking the 'sign in' button at the top right and then the 'create account if new user' button, the avatar with speech bubble presents you with a few related options question at a time process for creating an account, starting with email information, then area of preffered work, then current location questions. A progress bar at the top helps users understand how far along in the process they are.

3. **On Track** - [Creating Account](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/onboard) *same url*

![zr3](/assets/zr3.png)
>Part of the process is the website giving you a couple of jobs, and asking for you to select a couple that sound close to something you would want, which is realistically modifying their algorithm to help you find similar jobs and keep you on the right track.

4. **Final Step** - [Verifying Skills](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/profile/verify?onboarding_flow=1&eligibility_celebration_step=1)

![zr4](/assets/zr4.png)
> This final step in creating your profile is to upload your resume and then verify and complete skills/experience that it pulled from your resume. The website did a very good job, only thing I had to do was add and remove some skills. 

5. **Job Search** - [Search](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/search?search=cybersecurity&location=Mechanicsburg%2C+PA)

![zr5](/assets/zr5.png)

> From here, the website provided jobs related to cybersecurity within 25 miles of your location that you provided, as well as the ability to refine or broaded that search.

6. **Job Selection/Application** - [Application](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/ojob/335b6f6c9f937a440003d7b5d13edb9f?lvk=CVt_YduqtiSXyqblk_3hJg.--MNhuekzjk)

![zr6](/assets/zr6.png)

>After clicking on a job, the website provided a breif job description/qualifications with a green button which let you apply from an external website (the companies website). On the right side of the screen were similar jobs that one might find interesting instead.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 | The way it is setup, it is almost as if there is an actual recruiter asking you simple questions to help link you to a company.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | From start to finish it took less than 10 minutes, even less if you were happy with the way it processed your resume.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 |  Steps that were required were clearly labeled, optional steps were labeled similarily |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  3 |  The job lead you strait towards jobs that fit my "desired" path. In this case, I got over 51 cybersecurity jobs within 25 miles of mechanicsburg. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |  This website had as little words as needed per page, even the job descriptions were brief and seemed hand written. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | Following the workflow process as a starter was easy, but just exploring the website was also simple and effective towards getting to a desired path.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | The mobile experience was a little less optimized, it seemed like it was designed to be run on a browser or an actual mobile application, not just a mobile browser.  |
| **TOTAL** |  20/21 |  Overall I liked this website more than LinkedIn in terms of job search, however LinkedIn's networking oppertunities and social media type functions make it better in my mind. Overall a great website for both employers and potential employees. |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Finding A Location |
| Description / Steps | 1. The User Logs into their account. 2. The User navigates to community map (default page loaded from logging in). 3. User clicks "search/filter" button and provides necessary criteria for location desire. 4. User will click on a location(s) based on the output of the search. 5.

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/)
2. Competitor 2 [Gaia GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Searching for a trail by your city  | Navigate to the main screen, input desired city into the search bar and hit enter/click go.  |
| 2 | Logging into an account   | From the main screen, click the "Log In" button located at the top right-hand corner of the screen.  |
| 3 | Navigating to the AllTrails shop  | From the main screen, locate and hover over the drop-down list at the top left corner of the screen and click on "AllTrails Gear."   |
| 4 | Filter Trails by difficulty "easy" | Navigate to the Explorer page through the button in the top left labeled "explore". Locate the drop down menu in the filter towards the top of the screen that says "difficulty" and select "easy", then click "see [x] trails"   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions
*Completed by Dr. Susan Miller-Donat*

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Searching for a trail by your city | Very simple task from the home screen. Participant was able to navigate to AllTrails.com very easily from a google search, and then proceeded to type in "Mechanicsburg" into the giant search bar in the middle of the screen. No confusion, participant commented "that was easy"  |
| 2 | Logging Into An Account  |  From the explore page from last task, user clicked on the log in button at the top right corner. Participant commented that the button is in the same spot as it is on the home page. After using credentials provided to log in, user successfully logged in. |
| 3 | Navigating to the AllTrails shop  | Now using an account, User was able to find the "shop" drop down after a few seconds of looking. User was a little confused what AllTrails Gear vs Give Pro was, but settled on AllTrails Gear. |
| 4 | Filter Trails by difficulty "easy"  | Participant took about a minute trying to get out of the shop page and get back to the explore tab. After a little bit of trail and error, the explore page was found, and then the difficulty drop down was located, and the "easy" filter was selected. |


## Step 3.5 Findings

Based on the user interactions, here are three improvements to the workflow I beleive would benefit the user.
- Change the tabs of navigation to be buttons to an individual screen instead of just drop down options.
- Change the explore button at the top left to be better identifiable or distinguished since it is the main feature of the website. Make it green.
- Remove the saved tab in navigation for until a user logs in. Participant questioned why it was relavent to them if they hadn't signed in yet.

Two experiences I think were beneficial to the users were as follows.

- The Sign Up / Log In button being in the same place. Made it easy to navigate to at any point if the user wanted to log in or sign up.
- The giant search bar on the main page gives the user access to the main functionality of the website right up front.

I think as a team, we did a good job exploring the main functions of the website and giving the user a large majority of the experience of the website without them being a previous user. AllTrails has a lot of different funtions and a smooth learning curve that makes it very versatile for experienced hikers, but to a regular user just looking for a trail, we covered a lot of the website.

Next time, we could improve our usability test by including atleast one more complex feature of the application to see what the learning curve of the website/application is.

Conducting the test was an interesting experience since it seemed so elementary to me, however to my 50 year old mother, it might not have been so easy. It was interesting seeing the process of someone "figuring it out" and get more comfortable with the website as time went on, through trial and error.
