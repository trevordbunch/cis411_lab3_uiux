# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Handshake | 21 | Handshake is exactly what I want from a website. It's quick and simple to use. There's almost nothing I would change about it. |
| Indeed | 19 | Indeed is a very polished site. While there are slight navigation improvements it could make, it's still great at what it does. |

1. URL: https://joinhandshake.com/

Description: The Sign up button on this page is very clear and right next to it is the Log in button 
that I needed.

Description: Allowing the user to search for a school by typing in the beginning of its name makes the process much easier than scrolling through the entire list.

![hsu3](/assets/hsu3.png)

3. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/login?ref=app-domain

Description: I think this page was unnecessary. The last page could have taken me directly to the Messiah login without this extra go-between.

![hsu4](/assets/hsu4.png)

4. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu

Description: This homepage is satisfyingly simple and has standard links to other pages on the menu bar.

5. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/users/19740219

Description: The profile page doesn’t even require the user to open some kind of editing page to change their information. This makes the process easier.

6. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/users/19740219

Description: The Courses section is connected to the user’s school’s course registry for their major. This means classes they are likely to take will be suggested before they type them in.

7. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/users/19740219

Description: Businesses in the Handshake system will also be suggested in the Work & Volunteer Experience section.

### Finding a Job

![hsj1](/assets/hsj1.png)

1. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu

Description: “Jobs” is the first thing on the menu bar that catches my eye, as it should be on a job search website.

![hsj2](/assets/hsj2.png)

2. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&query=software%20engineering

3. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&query=software%20engineering

Description: The “Apply” button is wisely designed to stand out on the page.

4. URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&query=software%20engineering

Description: The “Apply” button even sticks to the bottom of the screen so users don’t have to search for it again after scrolling further down.

Description: The Sign In button is very clear, but the website doesn’t require the user to be logged in. They easily search for jobs without an account.

![inu2](/assets/inu2.png)

2. URL: https://www.indeed.com/?_ga=2.172536992.2079549508.1647550499-1588931221.1644868824

Description: The Sign In button is very clear, but the website doesn’t require the user to be logged in. They easily search for jobs without an account.

![inu3](/assets/inu3.png)

3. URL: https://www.indeed.com/

Description: The homepage itself serves as the job search page, but reaching other pages is just 
as easy as similar sites.

![inu4](/assets/inu4.png)

4. URL: https://my.indeed.com/resume?hl=en&co=US&from=gnav-homepage&_ga=2.138705840.2079549508.1647550499-1588931221.1644868824

Description: This page keeps the content in a centred column with only white space on the sides. This idea prevents clutter and information overload.

![inu5](/assets/inu5.png)

5. URL: https://my.indeed.com/resume?hl=en&co=US&from=gnav-homepage&_ga=2.138705840.2079549508.1647550499-1588931221.1644868824

Description: The user is taken to a new page when editing their information. I think this process could easily be done without navigating away from the profile page.

![inu6](/assets/inu6.png)

6. URL: https://profile.indeed.com/preferences
	
Description: Changing information is very simple and self-explanatory once the user is on the new page.

### Finding a Job

![inj1](/assets/inj1.png)

1. URL: https://www.indeed.com/

Description: Making a search bar for the location is practical because that is often the second most important criteria for any job search.

![inj2](/assets/inj2.png)

2. URL: https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=programmer%20entry%20level&l=US&vjk=6337d98260cce682

Description: There are plenty of additional criteria that can be added to the search, but they are grayed out to not overwhelm the user.

![inj3](/assets/inj3.png)

3. URL: https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=programmer%20entry%20level&l
=US&vjk=6337d98260cce682&advn=5680616533559579

Description: It’s difficult to read the job details since they’re in such a tiny scroll box. The box should be expanded somehow.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | The design of each page was very easy to understand. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | Once or twice I was taken to an unnecessary page. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | I always knew where I needed to click next. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | I was immediately shown the job search interface on the homepage. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | The wording was concise and to the point. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | Some areas, like the profile page, required more navigation than they should. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | A screen reader would easily work with this site since it mostly contains text. |

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
### Use Less Pages
If an action can be performed while remaining on the current page, then that's how it should be done. Navigating away from a page only increases the likelihood the user will get lost. Staying on the same page can also simplify processes like changing information. It makes more sense to have a related entry box pop up when a button is clicked rather than sending the user to an entirely new place.
