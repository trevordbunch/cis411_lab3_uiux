# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Handshake | 21 | Handshake is exactly what I want from a website. It's quick and simple to use. There's almost nothing I would change about it. |
| Indeed | 19 | Indeed is a very polished site. While there are slight navigation improvements it could make, it's still great at what it does. |

Description: The “Apply” button even sticks to the bottom of the screen so users don’t have to search for it again after scrolling further down.

Description: This page keeps the content in a centred column with only white space on the sides. This idea prevents clutter and information overload.

![inu5](/assets/inu5.png)

5. URL: https://my.indeed.com/resume?hl=en&co=US&from=gnav-homepage&_ga=2.138705840.2079549508.1647550499-1588931221.1644868824

### Finding a Job

1. URL: https://www.indeed.com/

Description: Making a search bar for the location is practical because that is often the second most important criteria for any job search.

=US&vjk=6337d98260cce682&advn=5680616533559579

Description: It’s difficult to read the job details since they’re in such a tiny scroll box. The box should be expanded somehow.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | The design of each page was very easy to understand. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | Once or twice I was taken to an unnecessary page. |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Building a Course Schedule |
| Description / Steps | The user creates an eight semester course schedule using a drag and drop menu that lists courses related to their major and gen ed's. |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | The user must be logged in with their Messiah account. |
| Postconditions | The user's actions are saved and they are able to sign back in later to view their schedule again. |

## Step 3.2 Identify a Competitive Product

Messiah Ecarps [http://huggs.messiah.edu/ecarps/](http://huggs.messiah.edu/ecarps/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a guest account. |  |
| 2 | Select major. |  |
| 3 | Arrange prefilled courses. |  |
| 4 | Add desired courses. |  |
| 5 | Correct any scheduling errors. |  |
| 6 | Logout. |  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a guest account. | The participant found the login process to be easy and intuitive. |
| 2 | Select major. | He also found major selection to be very clear and simple with no extra clutter. |
| 3 | Arrange prefilled courses. | When the participant selected a minor, the software did not include the new courses and raised errors immediately. |
| 4 | Add desired courses. | He found the course list to be way too long. Also, it took him time to understand the various abbreviations and shorthand. |
| 5 | Correct any scheduling errors. | He did find the red flags helpful for knowing what semesters needed additional courses. |
| 6 | Logout. | The participant found the logout button very easily. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
### Problems
1. A filter option for the course list would be very helpful.
2. There should be no red flags when the user begins.
3. Being able to find courses again once they’ve been removed is essential.

### Successes
1. The software automatically inserted all necessary courses for the selected major.
2. Red flags when courses are removed are helpful.

### Overview
Our group asked good questions to get the participant's honest opinion.

In the future, we could try using someone outside our team for tests.

The service we used wasn’t a perfect example. The software we want to create will have many different features. However, it did help us view our project in a different light.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
### Use Less Pages
If an action can be performed while remaining on the current page, then that's how it should be done. Navigating away from a page only increases the likelihood the user will get lost. Staying on the same page can also simplify processes like changing information. It makes more sense to have a related entry box pop up when a button is clicked rather than sending the user to an entirely new place.
