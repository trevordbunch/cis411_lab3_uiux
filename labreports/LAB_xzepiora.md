# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 19 | Overall I think that LinkedIn is a great site but there are definatly improvements that could be made especially surrounding the white space as it can make the density feel weird. I think it is very easy to use and has a lot of positives in terms of clear communication and easy navigation. I do not like the use of ads and unlimited content as it does make the site feel a little weird and more informal than professional. |
| Indeed | 16| Overall I think Indeed is a nice site but it is just not for me. I like how it is very basic and has a clean layout. I also like how it can auto detect your resume and make a resume for your profile based on the PDF you upload. I just think that it could actually have more on the site to make it clear what is viewable and what certain actions do. I also just prefer the social media feel which this website does not have at all. |

## 2.2 LinkedIn
![LinkedIn Homepage](Images/LinkedIn%20Home%20Screen.png)
LinkedIn is a website I already have an account for and use quite regularly. This is what the home page looks like when using the web browser. I don't like all of the white space on the sides it makes the center feel very cluttered. I also just don't like adds so the add on the side is distracting to me. To get to my profile all you have to do is click on your name from the left hand panel or click the me drop down arrow and hit view profile.


![LinkedIn Skills Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Skills.png)

Once you get to your profile you will be able to see your activity and all of the parts that you have added to your profile such as job experience and skills. Clicking on the skills tab allows you to see all of your skills and add more. I like how flexible the profile page is on LinkedIn. It is very easy to edit and there is a lot that can be changed. It is also very straight forward in terms of adding new content.

![LinkedIn Job Experience Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Job%20Experience.png)

This page shows all listed work experience. By clicking the pencil you can edit posted job descriptions and with the plus sign you can add new job descriptions. I think this looks very clean and is easy to use. I also like that it is very easy to add new jobs and make changes to previous descriptions.

![LinkedIn Job Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Job%20Page.png)

This page can be found by clicking the jobs icon from the navigation bar. From here you can search for specific job titles or companys but since I have my profile setup it recommends jobs in my field on the center of the page. I personally do not like the recommendations on the right side of the page but I am sure that they are helpful to some people. This page is very clear at showing what a user is looking for and makes it easy to save a lot of jobs at once so you can come back to them with the book mark feature.

![LinkedIn Specific Job Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Specific%20Job.png)

This is the page once you click on a specific job which I think is very plain and I appreciate that it does not have any ads. I also like that other jobs are listed on the side so you can quickly hop to another option when you finish with what you are on. The apply button is very clear and makes it easy to find. I also like that it tells you how many applicants there are as well as what skills from your profile match what the company is looking for.


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 |  The website is very good but some things can be tricky if you are not familiar with it. An example of this is how you have to add a location to the job search, you can't just search for a job. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  |  I think this site does a good job valuing my time because everything is very straight forward and easy to find. It is like many other social media sites though were they will just keep feeding you content to keep you on the platform. That is why I'm taking points off.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | Everything is labled very clearly which makes it very easy to find stuff. I think that it is a great setup.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |I don't think this site has any specific path for users other than trying to keep them on the site longer. Jobs get recommended to you but that is based on what you put in for your profile so you can control that by controlling what your profile is.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |This site does not use many words it has a nav bar and is clear about what each tab is. Everything else is just labled exactly how it is or has a short description about what it is.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | The naviation is very simple as the nav bar has everything you could need and then moving between pages is very clear.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  |I believe that this site is very accesible but since I am not very familar with these tools I do not feel confident to give it a 3 as I don't know how they work specifically and how they benefit people that need them.   |
| **TOTAL** |  19 |   |

## 2.3 Indeed
![Indeed Sign Up](Images/Indeed%20Sign%20in.png)
I have never used Indeed before so I have to create an account which I will do by continuing with Google. The page is very clear and clean as there is nothing on it other than the sign in box.

![Indeed Job Experience Page](Images/Indeed%20Jobs%20Experience.png)

Once you upload your resume on Indeed you can convert the PDF automatically to an Indeed resume. This Indeed resume takes all the information from your resume and puts it onto your profile. The page above is the result of what was created from converting my resume to an Indeed resume. I really like how it did this automatically as that is one thing I don't like about LinkedIn how I always have to update both. With Indeed if you just update your resume you can upload it and it will update your profile. This happned during account creation which is super convenient. 

![Indeed Skills Page](Images/Indeed%20Skills.png)

Indeed takes your skills right from your resume and adds them to the site which is great and they make it very easy to add more or remove ones from your resume. I like this page a lot as it is very clean and it easy to use. I also like that it has a lot more skills than LinkedIn does which is nice.

![Indeed Profile Page](Images/Indeed%20Profile.png)

Now that my account is created this is what my profile looks like. I am not a fan of this layout at all. I think it makes it look really bland and not engaging for people looking at my profile. I understand that Indeed is not social media like LinkedIn is but as a young person I think I am just much more used to the social media format. I do like that my resume is directly searchable and people can view just that which is nice but I think this site misses some of the things that LinkedIn has. Like how you can have service experiences and posts about your field. 

![Indeed Job Search Page](Images/Indeed%20Job%20Search%20Page.png)

This page is very similar in nature to LinkedIn. I think that both are fine and are very clear in communication. I also like how it is not cluttered with ads or random information it is just the jobs. My one complaint is more software related than UI related as for some reason it seems to pick up that I worked at a warehouse and prioritizes that instead of the fact that I have a degree in cybersecurity and have worked in cybersecurity. I do like how it highlights features that you picked for jobs like how I said I wanted full time positions so now the full time is highlighted. It makes it easy to see if the jobs have what I want. A serious complaint I do have though is that the right side is the job you have currently selected. There is no way to just view the job you selected. You have to view it on the side with the other jobs and scroll. It is easy to do I just think it makes it cluttered and I would rather have a seperate page to apply for my job.


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | I think that this site is incredibly simple but it is not very clear about what is viewable to employers. There are a lot of options for profile choices but it seems like only the Indeed resume is viewable. I also don't like how half of the nav bar has labels and the other half is just icons. I think that they should both be labled to make it very clear. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 | This site has no clutter and is very straight to the point.   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | It makes the job listings very clear which is important for a job website but the personal profile information is a little weird which makes it not totally clear. I think the two most important things on this site should be job listings and profiles and it seems like they really focus on the job listings and not the profile.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | I think this is exactly the same as LinkedIn the algorithm trys to pick jobs and interests that you have and highlight those to you. It is not difficult to overcome this though and does not really impact your use of the site.
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  |  I think that some things on this site were very unclear. There was hardly any words on the website but this could make it difficult to know what was happening. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  |Navigation was very simple but I did not like how the nav bar was split half and half. With some being words and others only being icons. I also did not like how certain pages were put together instead of just being seperate pages.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  |This is the same as LinkedIn I do not know enough about the results of these tools and their effectiveness based on the layout of the site. As far as I can tell it seems very accessible and I can not see how the layout would cause any issues with the tools that would make them not work.|
