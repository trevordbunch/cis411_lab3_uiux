# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 19 | Overall I think that LinkedIn is a great site but there are definatly improvements that could be made especially surrounding the white space as it can make the density feel weird. I think it is very easy to use and has a lot of positives in terms of clear communication and easy navigation. I do not like the use of ads and unlimited content as it does make the site feel a little weird and more informal than professional. |

## 2.2 LinkedIn
![LinkedIn Homepage](Images/LinkedIn%20Home%20Screen.png)
LinkedIn is a website I already have an account for and use quite regularly. This is what the home page looks like when using the web browser. I don't like all of the white space on the sides it makes the center feel very cluttered. I also just don't like adds so the add on the side is distracting to me. To get to my profile all you have to do is click on your name from the left hand panel or click the me drop down arrow and hit view profile.


![LinkedIn Skills Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Skills.png)

Once you get to your profile you will be able to see your activity and all of the parts that you have added to your profile such as job experience and skills. Clicking on the skills tab allows you to see all of your skills and add more. I like how flexible the profile page is on LinkedIn. It is very easy to edit and there is a lot that can be changed. It is also very straight forward in terms of adding new content.

![LinkedIn Job Experience Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Job%20Experience.png)

This page shows all listed work experience. By clicking the pencil you can edit posted job descriptions and with the plus sign you can add new job descriptions. I think this looks very clean and is easy to use. I also like that it is very easy to add new jobs and make changes to previous descriptions.

![LinkedIn Job Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Job%20Page.png)

This page can be found by clicking the jobs icon from the navigation bar. From here you can search for specific job titles or companys but since I have my profile setup it recommends jobs in my field on the center of the page. I personally do not like the recommendations on the right side of the page but I am sure that they are helpful to some people. This page is very clear at showing what a user is looking for and makes it easy to save a lot of jobs at once so you can come back to them with the book mark feature.

![LinkedIn Specific Job Page](Images/LinkedIn%20Specific%20Job.png)

This is the page once you click on a specific job which I think is very plain and I appreciate that it does not have any ads. I also like that other jobs are listed on the side so you can quickly hop to another option when you finish with what you are on. The apply button is very clear and makes it easy to find. I also like that it tells you how many applicants there are as well as what skills from your profile match what the company is looking for.


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 |  The website is very good but some things can be tricky if you are not familiar with it. An example of this is how you have to add a location to the job search, you can't just search for a job. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  |  I think this site does a good job valuing my time because everything is very straight forward and easy to find. It is like many other social media sites though were they will just keep feeding you content to keep you on the platform. That is why I'm taking points off.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | Everything is labled very clearly which makes it very easy to find stuff. I think that it is a great setup.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |I don't think this site has any specific path for users other than trying to keep them on the site longer. Jobs get recommended to you but that is based on what you put in for your profile so you can control that by controlling what your profile is.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |This site does not use many words it has a nav bar and is clear about what each tab is. Everything else is just labled exactly how it is or has a short description about what it is.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | The naviation is very simple as the nav bar has everything you could need and then moving between pages is very clear.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  |I believe that this site is very accesible but since I am not very familar with these tools I do not feel confident to give it a 3 as I don't know how they work specifically and how they benefit people that need them.   |
| **TOTAL** |  19 |   |
