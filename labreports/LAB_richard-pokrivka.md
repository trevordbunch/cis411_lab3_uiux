# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Site 1: **Indeed** | 17/21 | Overall, this was a very good site that made searching for a job relatively easy but was lacking in the ommitting words aspect and telling me what to do area. |
| Site 2: **Handshake** | 13/21 | Overall, the site functions very well for finding jobs but the actual process of applying is very limited due to being forced to apply externally which results in a big waste of time for the user and makes them wonder why they are even using the site in the first place. |

## 2.2 Site 1: Indeed

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 | The site allowed me to upload a resume to my profile which then all the information on that resume was automatically added to an indeed resume which required little thought for me. However, it was a little confusing getting to that point initially. Also, the site looked for jobs based on my past work instead of area of study which in my scenario was not very helpful ![1](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRrGPuKWxI0w-2vHzac1X4B4DheFLgCxNIIsZH98YTY0BRSxnSOy4UDo-xbUd--xUTXNIOQX8uqTuLn/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  |  Yes because in the job application portion, the site automatically applied information from my resume which meant I did not have to enter data it already had. ![2](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQWnGcnt1bSgJmrh2uu3Tj85RaxUnnSEduWxHVWomX9U3v5B4sQSE0JfkvyLXjtYYx8sJlar_149tLP/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | Yes because there were big red boxes where I did not enter neccessary information which clearly told me I missed something important. ![3](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRwPcegklmVVcy83W-A0kLoch2vtZ6dHMXU14uedv051fPVszTwD3UbvYLxK6vjm68rnuEUGOZLC1CA/pub?w=960&h=720)  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1  | Not really. I did not feel compelled to really do anything but I did trust the site slightly because it had all my information present. ![4](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSIDRI-ZdMqJ0VgsgCRJaVAmSXO29SRbhMXLpkxQ83813H4to2dSejbtJOAfjCPs12LuE9e1hQZ_iCG/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  | The site did not go overboard with words but definitely repeated some of the some things regarding my personal information probably more than was needed. ![5](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSIDRI-ZdMqJ0VgsgCRJaVAmSXO29SRbhMXLpkxQ83813H4to2dSejbtJOAfjCPs12LuE9e1hQZ_iCG/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 |  The site gave a number of steps to complete and had a progress bar that moved with my progress which made me feel close to finish. ![6](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQrOVfOhGkf3QcrJRMoe-9lXKiXO9JQM_1EUa-SiYHTRhzBjpDiNOpbSE3oY5vcvEz0mbuRji2AQ-Ny/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 |  I attempted the site on my mobile device and it worked perfectly fine. ![7](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRHfLKhXE0PT5u0_ACIr0ks5F7n_9q7SN5muKJBr8-w8Fh5ZMLVTPVJCf30v30g74txJ-laJSiWZqJP/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| **TOTAL** |  17/21 | Overall, this was a very good site that made searching for a job relatively easy but was lacking in the ommitting words aspect and telling me what to do area.  |

## 2.3 Site 2
Note: I already had a Handshake account

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3   |  The site was very intuitive in the sense that it asked for a resume and found specific jobs related to ym field of study ![1](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTifD-8ysO5MgnYYuQWpulimUrWhlI-6KEBcHYIregf7m2ySHS5g71LLYdKW6ZbACJKqHtf0wmeL7Jf/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  1 | The site did not value my time because I would need to apply to every job externally which requires creating accounts and entering information for every single job instead of having a central hub that has all my information ![2](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vT6Ly3HOFYWlp9rDcwUziDYIWzNaoQsjem7PdYQccsxwsxc95rKjA5RUXKkPeNHP8IZgAjKL3AmD5RG/pub?w=960&h=720)   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  2 |  It did make the important steps clear by showing me how to apply but having to do it externally for every job makes every process unique and not very clear overall ![3](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTifD-8ysO5MgnYYuQWpulimUrWhlI-6KEBcHYIregf7m2ySHS5g71LLYdKW6ZbACJKqHtf0wmeL7Jf/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2 |  The site told me where to go with a big red "apply externally" button but the site itself was not very helpful for applying ![4](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRLRoA2XjytAHBvKbYNtNNdV4eo7SmpIlBUlaZRI4tLEJ6XMiecHRNxqI4JRgVRuVtf06kGxyTcdNJx/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  1 |  The site has a massive amount of words for every job which makes looking for specific information very difficult and makes the overall site very wordy. ![5](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRPoPvPdJQOaXNhDOMv1NjL5CyvxIe7Oqf43aMaFJWIjdYzcdBXgHYJldFfWUdBgcqCdKDJuFEEPwhE/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1  | The overall effectiveness of the navigation was not very good because of having to apply everywhere externally plus navigating all the information is very inconvenient and difficult ![6](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vT6Ly3HOFYWlp9rDcwUziDYIWzNaoQsjem7PdYQccsxwsxc95rKjA5RUXKkPeNHP8IZgAjKL3AmD5RG/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | Handshake works very well in a screen reader environment and there were no issues using the site on my mobile device ![7](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSqbifwF4F2vaRTiSXX5FnQNz142beyrjbgmZEz3kmOtTEYBgDVsV2Gn1bSBWhx1fqN7r0UVYTYV8VA/pub?w=960&h=720) |
| **TOTAL** |  13/21 |  Overall, the site functions very well for finding jobs but the actual process of applying is very limited due to being forced to apply externally which results in a big waste of time for the user and makes them wonder why they are even using the site in the first place. |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | Students  |
|---|---|
| Title |First Year Student Creates Account to Look at UnderGraduate Coursework |
| Description / Steps | Student accesses the Undergraduate course software via falconlink or google search. They verify their login with Messiah Credentials and then they can move courses around to specific semesters to see how their schedule would align. Errors such as time conflicts, incorrect order of prerequisites, or course not being offered would produce an error that the user must resolve before they can then save the movements. When they leave and reopen the software, the progress should be saved.|
| Primary Actor | Students |
| Preconditions | Student has a Messiah email and signs in using the cache system |
| Postconditions | Student progress for moving courses around and ordering them in specific semesters is saved when they come back|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Adjacent Tool 1 [http://huggs.messiah.edu/ecarps/](http://huggs.messiah.edu/ecarps/)
   ![Ecarps](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTyKJxIKPgRyLqq9oFfvTLrRSPdyITkZx4dsHaTncxcCU1T0gWivv-jL9iSmcXAGrknLrXqXcjxbLcD/pub?w=960&h=720)


## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in as Guest  |  Choose Guest not Messiah |
| 2 | Select Major  | Select one of the Engineering majors  |
| 3 | Select Concentration/Minor  |  Choose a random concentration or minor |
| 4 | Move the Courses as Seen fit  | Experiment with the moving courses feature  |
| 5 | Add Courses as Needed  | Experiment with the add course feature  |
| 6 |  Fix Errors |  Resolve any errors |
| 7 | Log Out | Leave Ecarps when finished |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in as Guest | Pretty easy login process, inputs were easy  |
| 2 | Select Major  |  very easy process, basic, simple, very straightforward |
| 3 | Select Concentration/Minor  | will do that for fun, when selected a confusing error was thrown because the courses wern't automatically added|
| 4 | Move the Courses as Seen Fit| Moving a course was easy enough, errors were thrown when a course no longer had the correct prerequisites which was helpful |
| 5 | Add Courses as Needed  |  very difficult to find courses to add because it's one giant column with no way to search for specific classes, there should be a sorting system too for example when a minor was added, none of the courses were placed on automatically so being able to sort by required courses would make the process easier |
| 6 | Fix Errors  |  Red is very helpful for when errors are present, red typically means something wrong and that point is clearly made |
| 7 | Log Out| Very simple process, took one button click|

## Step 3.5 Findings
### Improvements
Ability to search or sort the courses on the side.

### Beneficial Experiences
Automatically filling all the neccessary courses for a major in different semesters is very helpful especially for someone that may be new/inexperienced.
The prerequisite flagging when moving courses is helpful for preventing scheduling errors.

### Usability Test Success
Asking loaded questions such as how doing certain processes made the users feel, where there was any confusion, and more just to get honest feedback was a very successful aspect and allowed our group to 

### Usability Test Improvement
Our team could get a "pure" outsider. We used Jamie, a member of our team, and we all had a general understanding of the process from looking at ECARPS for writing the Usability Test. Having someone with absolutely zero experience with the process, should provide some different and potentially more meaningful feedback.

### Experience
Having the outline allowed for better information to be extracted from the process

## Step 4 The 11th Rule
### Accessibility for All
In today's day and age, more and more people with differring circumstances need to be considered and accounted for. It would be selfish to assume a website created under one person would work the same for everyone. Thus, color choices need to be taken into consideration to account for people sufferring from color blindness or other visual impairments and all images need to to have alternate text descriptions to ensure a screen reader can adequately describe the site for someone with a difficulty with sight or other visual impairment.
