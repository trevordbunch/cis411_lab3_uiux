# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1 | Creating a profile was easy. Finding jobs was tougher as I needed a specific company or position. Some companies that I know did not appear. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Application took only 3 steps and had a gauge with percentage completed. Jobs showed just the relevant information. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 0 | Steps on application were things you could put on profile. I found it unclear if this was because I neglected these on my profile or if it would've asked me regardless. How much was my profile taken into consideration when applying? |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | First job posting was front and center but there was too much white space. Could've easily made it even more prominent. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Was not overly wordy nor did it not provide enough information. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1 | It felt like you were only ever given one option for jobs at a time. I found that searches were not very intuitive. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0 | Did not see any options to optimize for accessibility. |
| **TOTAL** | 12 | /21 |

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Very easy to use. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Gauge was present in the application, wasn't overly long. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | Did not have to work hard to find jobs. Highlighted job takes up most of the space with all the neccessary information. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | Could enter the criteria needed and gave the best matched result. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Was not overly wordy and still provided sufficient information. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | Very easy to navigate. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0 | Did not see any options to optimize for accessibility. |
| **TOTAL** | 18 | /21 |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Joining a prayer circle off of a received link. |
| Description / Steps | User receives a link to join a prayer circle. User clicks on the link and is redirected to a sign in/up page. User clicks the sign up button. User enters their information and is logged in. User is automatically added into the circle upon logging in. |
| Primary Actor | A new personal user who has received an invite |
| Preconditions | Associates have created a circle and have invited someone to join who does not own an account. |
| Postconditions | The user creates an account and becomes a part of the prayer circle. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [faithmeet](www.faithmeet.com)
2. Competitor 2 [prayerchainonline](www.prayerchainonline.net)
3. Competitor 3 [biblefolk](biblefolk.com)
4. Competitor 4 [101christainsocialnetwork](www.101christainsocialnetwork.com)
5. Competitor 5 [indiegospel](indiegospel.net)

I will be conducting the test on 101christainsocialnetwork.

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Click on Bible in the navigation bar. | How intuitive is the navigation bar? |
| 2 | Select a book of the Bible. | A list of Bible books is displayed. |
| 3 | Select a chapter from your chosen book. | This is at the top of the page but might get overlooked. |
| 4 | Click on a number next to a Bible verse. | A list of Bible verse is displayed. |
| 5 | Read the meaning and commentary section. | Does the meaning and commentary section provide good insight? |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Click on Bible in the navigation bar. | (This covers all of the tasks.) The user was successfully able to navigate to their chosen verse. It required more scrolling than was felt neccessary. |
| 2 | Select a book of the Bible. |  |
| 3 | Select a chapter from your chosen book. |  |
| 4 | Click on a number next to a Bible verse. | User was successful in finding their chosen verse and commentary. |
| 5 | Read the meaning and commentary section. | This section did not seem to be referring to the selected verse. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
1. The constant overhead bars and side bars were distracting. There was more scrolling then was needed. There appeared to be inaccuracies.  
2. The UI was intuitive for the Books and chapters of the Bible. The version used could be changed to suit the user.  
3. Instructions were straightforward and didn't lead to confusion outside of any issues with the website. 
4. I believe I could use more practice in setting tasks and recognizing what I should be looking to get out of those tasks.  
5. The website was serviceable but could've been optimized to give a better user experience. It felt like their interests were more geared towards navigating the user towards their other sites rather than keeping with this one.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
**Interactiveness**  
This probably applies to more specific websites, but I think a good way to keep a user's attention would be to make the website interactive. Rather than having them follow a string of links or scrolling through a simple page, make something that the user can interact with. Examples could include having a side menu that needs to be dragged out or a graph with adjustable variables. Interaction requires more focus than scrolling, and makes it stand out amongst other websites.
