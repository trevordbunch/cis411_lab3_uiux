# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Site 1 | 12 | ZipRecruiter.com is a job website that is very lazy. They seem to not encourage employers to provide information directly on the site. You are faced rather with little squares that have a job title, location, and no much else unless you want to navigate to that jobs website/Linkedin. There is also a lot of blank space that is not utilized and if a job decides to put information on there ZipRecruiter it navigates you to another page where another small inefficient square squishes all the information the middle. |
| Site 2 | 16 | Indeed.com is an efficient and compact website. It allows you to scroll through jobs while seeing the most important information of that job upfront. Indeed also has all the job information on the site so when you click on a jobs square it pulls up all the information to the right of the little square. This is very efficient for acquiring information fast without having to navigate away from your search results.

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | I was able to get to where I wanted to go without much thought but there were multiple ways to do it. There were also multiple formats for the job search depending upon how you got to it. Overall could be simplified ![](/assets/1.1.png) |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1 | No, there were many pop ups wanting us to use the site the way the developers wanted us to. It was time consuming trying to exit and avoid them and get to the jobs. There were also prompts that were hard to see how to skip so you could just look at job search results. ![](/assets/1.2.png) |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | The process and steps towards actually applying for a job were pretty emphasized but they sometimes got cutoff by a pop-up or the website wanting to extract more information from you. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | Yes, they did have steps for you to take in order to apply for jobs that were relevant to you. The path had some bumps but it lead to the same place in the end. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | It did a good job at focusing its copy to point you in the right direction navigation wise. It was clear what the website wants to help you with and help you accomplish. ![](/assets/1.3.png) |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1 | The workflow was really slow and took too much navigation to get the information on the jobs you want. The lists of jobs took clicks to get more information and a change of web page to get useful information on any job title. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2 | The site works well on mobile and the screen reader works well. The responsiveness is good but squishes the space a little. |
| **TOTAL** | 12 |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | The site allows you to navigate smoothly and has limited distractions towards achieving your desired actions with the site. ![](/assets/2.1.png) |

| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | This site was really good at predicting what the user wants to see about a job and giving the user that information in a way were the workflow could be quick and effective. It gave you details only when you navigated as such and didn't make the navigation over complex. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | This site effectively pushes you toward landing on there job search page and scrolling through. The search allows for filtering and allows you to find what you are looking for. ![](/assets/2.3.png) |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1 | The copy wasn't emphasized and put into a visual which made the site less attractive. The site also had some information that didn't apply to getting a job, not necessarily bad in different contexts though. ![](/assets/2.4.png) |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | This site has great workflow that allows you to see job information quickly without much navigation away from your original search. The navigation is simple and accomplishes what you want quickly. When you search you have a dual scroll design as well. ![](/assets/2.5.png) |
