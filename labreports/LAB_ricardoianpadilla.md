# Step 1: Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluation of Online Job Search Sites
https://www.indeed.com/  and  https://www.linkedin.com/
## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Linkedin | 18.5 | Over all this was a great site, but with a few flaws of adding unnecessary option based on the users intention. |
| Indeed | 17.75 |This site was strait to the point but was alittle too dull and could have added ways to make the user do less work when it cam to uplouding the resume.Because the resume is require to use this site I feel it should have been apart of the regristration process instead of the user having to find it in the setting on profile.|

Clicking Skip
![image.](/linkedinUXimages/12.png)
Clicking Skip(Clicking skip for the third time shows that there are things being put into the create an account process that are not needed. This in my opion is a waste of the users time. Although the waste of time is small it is annoying in some cases.)

Clicking next.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3.0 |  It was a pretty normal sign-up, navigating through the page was easy. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2.0  |  It has things that weren't necessary for the signup. If I have to click skip more than 3 times its too much(especially if it doesn't correlate with the signup process).But outside the sign-up process it seem fast.|

| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2.0 |  Yes it did but in signup showing the user it connect option showing what linkedin is known for but outside of the sign in process the user is free to take any path they want.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3.0 | Overall this site was well off  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2.5 | Navigation was easy and fast to learn. But there was still learning involved |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3.0  |  "As part of LinkedIns commitment to accessibility they continuously audit thier products—internally and through a third party—using assistive technology such as screen reading software (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack)." |
| **TOTAL** |  18.5|   |

## Step 3.4 Observation of User Interactions

```Competitor 1```
| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Search for a trail base on users city |  The user clicked on searchbar then clicked on "all" then clicked on "trails" then clicked on "locations" then exited search bar and scrolled through until he found "near me" section of the home page. |
| 2 |  Sign into or create account  |  The user click the sign button and didnt create an account and just went back to the home page |

```Competitor 2```
| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| 2 | Sign into or create account  |  The user looks around for 10 second then clicks on the expandable menu then clicks sign up. he chooses not to sign up because he doesn't want emails from this application.|
| 3 | Go to alltrails shop. Note: because this site didn't have a shop I asked the tester to find how to sign up for a premium feature)| The user remembered that in the footer there was a Outside++ option when looking for the map. He quickly finds where he can sign up for a premium feature.|
| 4 |  Search trails based on dificulty | After the failed expirence of the user trying to find a location based on location the user decided to click on a option location text link near him. and was greeted with a list that showed the difficulty level under each option. He wasnt able to search based on difficulty but was able to sort the option base on difficulty.  |


## Step 3.5 Findings
```Competitor 1```

Cons:
<ul><li>The user found the drop menu in the search bar to be confusing because it not a common and hard to figure out how to navigate.</li><li>The user did strugle looking for how to choose the difuculty level of trail</li></ul>
Pros:
<ul><li>The user did find it conveniet to scroll down compare to using the search bar with the locations near him being on the homepage.</li><li>The user found the show quickly.</li><li>The login was fast for him and yes to find</li></ul>

```Competitor 2```

Cons:

Based on the users reaction looking for something for more than 10 seconds is frustraing to the user.</li><li>The user didnt like how the home page to the site was purely a signup page. He felt thatn he has to sign up before getting access to the application.</li></ul>
Pros:
<ul><li>When the user did find the map it had a good layout</li>

# 4. My UX Rule 
```Title:``` The Forceless rule
```Pithy usability rule:``` In the design of your application the user shouldn't be prompted with any unnecessary steps to use the application. Adding extra steps to a user's experience is considered forceful and time-consuming.

```Support/Reason:```
While users should be guided through the process of an application through the proper design of a site, it should be done without any unnecessary steps. During the process of completing this assignment. The most frustrating part of most of the sites is introducing an option that is not needed to use the application. For example on LinkedIn, the user simply wanted to sign up and was given 4 extra pages where I read through thinking it was required for the sign-up process but found it was only about a feature of the site that can be skipped meaning it's not necessary to use the site. Second in the second competitor of our usability test the tester of the site thought it was necessary to sign up in order to simply search a location. This was because on the home page of the application the user is only greeted with a signup page. Being that the user can access the map without signing up the home page should be the map as that is the application of the site. Being that most sites force users to see or do things that are not necessary for the use of their application, I feel this isn't respecting the time of the user as my roommate found frustration with competitor 2 of this assignment.
