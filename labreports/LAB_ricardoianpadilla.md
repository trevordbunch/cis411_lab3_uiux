# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites
https://www.indeed.com/  and  https://www.linkedin.com/
## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Linkedin | 18.5 | Over all this was a great site, but with a few flaws of adding unnecessary option based on the users intention. |
| Indeed | 17.75 |This site was strait to the point but was alittle too dull and could have added ways to make the user do less work when it cam to uplouding the resume.Because the resume is require to use this site I feel it should have been apart of the regristration process instead of the user having to find it in the setting on profile.|

Clicking Skip
![image.](/linkedinUXimages/12.png)
Clicking Skip(Clicking skip for the third time shows that there are things being put into the create an account process that are not needed. This in my opion is a waste of the users time. Although the waste of time is small it is annoying in some cases.)

Clicking Skip(Fourth time!!)

Clicking next.
![image.](/linkedinUXimages/15.png)

| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2.0  |  It has things that weren't necessary for the signup. If I have to click skip more than 3 times its too much(especially if it doesn't correlate with the signup process).But outside the sign-up process it seem fast.|

| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2.0 |  Yes it did but in signup showing the user it connect option showing what linkedin is known for but outside of the sign in process the user is free to take any path they want.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3.0 | Overall this site was well off  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2.5 | Navigation was easy and fast to learn. But there was still learning involved |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3.0  |  "As part of LinkedIns commitment to accessibility they continuously audit thier products—internally and through a third party—using assistive technology such as screen reading software (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack)." |
| **TOTAL** |  18.5|   |

| 4 |  Search trails based on dificulty | The user can click explore and has the option to find locations based on the difficult level or location.  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

```Competitor 1```
| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Search for a trail base on users city |  The user clicked on searchbar then clicked on "all" then clicked on "trails" then clicked on "locations" then exited search bar and scrolled through until he found "near me" section of the home page. |
| 2 |  Sign into or create account  |  The user click the sign button and didnt create an account and just went back to the home page |

```Competitor 2```
| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Search for a trail base on users city  |The user could not find how to do so without signing up for the first 15 seconds.After 20 seconds he founs in the footer a find trails link. He trys inputing his zip code into the search bar but then gets a error page 404 which i consider a fail for this site |
| 2 | Sign into or create account  |  The user looks around for 10 second then clicks on the expandable menu then clicks sign up. he chooses not to sign up because he doesn't want emails from this application.|
| 3 | Go to alltrails shop. Note: because this site didn't have a shop I asked the tester to find how to sign up for a premium feature)| The user remembered that in the footer there was a Outside++ option when looking for the map. He quickly finds where he can sign up for a premium feature.|
| 4 |  Search trails based on dificulty | After the failed expirence of the user trying to find a location based on location the user decided to click on a option location text link near him. and was greeted with a list that showed the difficulty level under each option. He wasnt able to search based on difficulty but was able to sort the option base on difficulty.  |

```Competitor 1```
Cons:
<ul><li>The user found the drop menu in the search bar to be confusing because it not a common and hard to figure out how to navigate.</li><li>The user did strugle looking for how to choose the difuculty level of trail</li></ul>
Pros:
<ul><li>The user did find it conveniet to scroll down compare to using the search bar with the locations near him being on the homepage.</li><li>The user found the show quickly.</li><li>The login was fast for him and yes to find</li></ul>

```Competitor 2```

Based on the users reaction looking for something for more than 10 seconds is frustraing to the user.</li><li>The user didnt like how the home page to the site was purely a signup page. He felt thatn he has to sign up before getting access to the application.</li></ul>
Pros:
<ul><li>When the user did find the map it had a good layout</li>
