# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score |  |
|---|---|---|
| ZipRecuiter | 17.7 | I expected to like this site, because it had great reviews. I really liked how easy it was to complete the two actions on this site. I really liked how simple and intuitive the sign up process was to complete. This site seemed to be accessible without a mouse and using the screen reader. The site did have some pages that seemed pointless and I did not like the one click apply feature. |
| Dice | 10 | I expected to dislike this site because I heard that it was not friendly to use. The sign up process had several points where I was wondering why they had made the choices that they did. The main problem I had was with the skills section. The top five skills could not be deleted regardless if there were more than five total skills. This made this section difficult to edit. I also disliked that articles appeared on my profile page and the amount of pop-ups on the site. |

## 2.2 Site 1

Step 1
![Step 1](/assets/Site1pt1.PNG)
I liked how the site could use my gmail account to speed up the profile creation step.  

Step 2
![Step 2](/assets/Site1pt2.PNG) 
I liked how the site had a feature that would show you a list of jobs similar to the one you were typing. 

Step 3
![Step 3](/assets/Site1pt3.PNG) 
I liked how you could set each of these features. I would change this section to clearly state what each of the options do. I assume the not looking but open limits the amount of emails the site will send, but I am not completely sure.

Step 4
![Step 4](/assets/Site1pt4.PNG)  
I loved this feature of the sign up process. It will help the site select jobs based off preference. Many sites I have seen lack this refinement step for their search algorithms.

Step 5 <br>
This image is missing because it was a resume upload button. As soon as the site accepts the resume it moves on. There were also some boxes you could fill out if you did not have a resume. I disliked that the site would move on if it accepted a resume. I would change this to a complete button, in case the user uploads the wrong document by accident. 

Step 6
![Step 6](/assets/Site1pt6.PNG) 
Nothing to say about this page. I would remove it because it does not add anything to the process.

Step 7
![Step 7](/assets/Site1pt7.PNG)  
This page was intuitive to use and I have seen this functionality on pretty much every job site.

Step 8
![Step 8](/assets/Site1pt8.PNG)  
This is the profile page so the user can edit their profile. This site didn't have anything super unique here, but I was able to find everything I could want to add or change.

Step 9
![Step 9](/assets/Site1pt9.PNG)  
I liked how there was a description box so a user could fill in extra relevant information if they wanted too.

Step 10
![Step 10](/assets/Site1pt10.PNG)  
This step is almost identical to how Linkedin handles users adding skills. A user can then certify their skills if they want.

Step 11
![Step 11](/assets/Site1pt11.PNG)  
There is more information at the bottom of the profile page for when a user has a lot of experience and expectations they can add it. 

Step 12
![Step 12](/assets/Site1pt12.PNG) 
A user can add a phone number. 

Step 13
![Step 13](/assets/Site1pt13.PNG)  
A user can add a location. I liked how there was an option to see jobs that could be remote or require a user to relocate.

Step 14
![Step 14](/assets/Site1pt14.PNG)  
A user can add references to their profile

Step 15
![Step 15](/assets/Site1pt15.PNG)  
Here is where the job results appear. I like how they are spaced out in boxes. This makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the information clearly tied to a specific job.

Step 16
![Step 16](/assets/Site1pt16.PNG)  
There is a one click apply for jobs on this site. I did not see an option for a lengthier application. I would change this as a 1-click apply is convenient, but does not allow users to see what specific information is being sent to the company.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  |  The site was very easy to use. At no point in the process of signing up or applying for a job was I confused or unsure of what to do. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | There were a lot of steps and a few pages that I feel should have been condensed or removed.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  |  Many of the important steps were required or appeared in a checkbox on the right side of the profile page. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | This site allows companies to post jobs for free. I did not  see one company appearing an unusual amount of times. I have only used the site for this project so I cannot say for sure, but I believe the site is not trying to push people into a specific path.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 |  The site had a few things I would not have added. Overall it was not overly wordy. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  The site was easy to navigate. The site had good guidance for registering and updating profiles.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2.7 |  The site supports the standard mouse-less interface keys. I cannot say if it is worse or better than normal, but I was able to navigate around and preform the same actions. I was also able to navigate the site with a screen reader but ran into several problems where key information was not read when I felt it should have been. This might have been a problem with my screen reader as I am not used to using screen readers. |
| **TOTAL** |  17.7 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

Step 1
![Step 1](/assets/Site2pt1.PNG)  
It was easy to find where to sign up. The amount of pop-ups made it hard to look at and fought for my attention. This immediately made me want to leave the site. I would remove the pop-ups as they do not add much to the site.

Step 2
![Step 2](/assets/Site2pt2.PNG)  
I liked this page. It had everything I was expecting.

Step 3
![Step 3](/assets/Site2pt3.PNG)  
I do not understand the point of this page. I would remove this page.

Step 4
![Step 4](/assets/Site2pt4.PNG)  
This page was the same as on many other job sites. I like that it supported more file types than the others I have seen.

Step 5
![Step 5](/assets/Site2pt5.PNG) 
I disliked this page greatly. The skills section is frustrating to use. I understand why they would ask about the date last used, but you cannot remove skills in the top 5 slots. I wanted to remove C++ as I do not remember the year I used it. To do this I had to replace it with a skill below the top 5 slots and then remove that skill. This was not a huge problem, but the solution would be very simple to implement. I would change this to have no minimum of skills or allow the user to remove any skills until there are 5 skills left.

Step 6
![Step 6](/assets/Site2pt6.PNG)  
This is the profile page. I did not like how articles showed up on this page. It felt like the user profile was not the focus of this page. The articles also fought for my attention as I was trying to find where to update different parts of my profile.

Step 7
![Step 7](/assets/Site2pt7.PNG)  
I did like how an estimated salary prediction appeared on your profile page. I also liked the career transitions and path recommendations. 

Step 8
![Step 8](/assets/Site2pt8.PNG)  
I did not like how they added my phone number from the resume without specifically asking. I know it was probably in the terms of service, but it still feels a little annoying when personal information is not specifically asked for in a dialog box.

Step 9
![Step 9](/assets/Site2pt9.PNG)  
The process to add a skill is pretty simple.

Step 10
![Step 10](/assets/Site2pt10.PNG)  
I disliked this page because the job boxes did not display much information and there were too few of them per page. 

Step 11
![Step 11](/assets/Site2pt11.PNG)  
I liked how much information was displayed once the job was clicked on. 

Step 12
![Step 12](/assets/Site2pt12.PNG)  
I liked how you could choose what resume you used to apply for the job.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1.5  | This site was quite annoying to use as various pop-ups fought for my attention and several times I was confused as to why the site makers choose to make the site function as it does.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  0 | While signing up was quick, I felt the primary focus of the site was making me click on articles.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |  The site makes almost everything required, so everything you needed to apply was already done by the time you were allowed to apply. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1.5  |  The articles and career transitions lead me to believe that the site is trying to force me down a specific path. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  |  This site was not overly wordy, but there were times I wondered why some things were not omitted. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1  | The artiles really cluttered but the site overall and broke up the navigation and workflow.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1.5  | I could not figure out how to navigate to certain parts of the site without a mouse and my screen reader was hard to use on this site. This may be due to my lack of knowledge however.  |
| **TOTAL** | 10  |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case
![Step 11](/assets/useCase.png)  
| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Register |
| Description / Steps | <ol> <li> The user navigates to the landing page </li> <li> The User clicks the register for account button </li> <li> The user enters their information in the ways provided </li> <li> The server stores the user's entered information </li> <li> The server returns the user's filled in profile page </li> </ol>  |
| Primary Actor | The user |
| Preconditions | The user is a Messiah student |
| Postconditions | <ol> <li> The user can sign in to their account </li> <li> The user can sign out of their account</li> <li> The user can register up for events set up by the clubs </li> </oi> |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Instagram [www.instagram.com](www.instagram.com)
2. Discord [www.discord.com](www.discord.com) This will be the tested site.

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | 
|---|---|
| 1 | Go to the website register page |
| 2 | Fill out all of the required fields to register |
| 3 | Click the register button |
| 4 | Get the two factor authentication set up |
| 4 | User can show that they have an account set up |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Go to the website register page | The user found the specific place to register annoying to find. |
| 2 | Fill out all of the required fields to register | This step was very straight forward. |
| 3 | Click the register button | This step was very straight forward. |
| 4 | Get the two factor authentication set up | The user found this annoying because it required you to click on the email on the device setting up the account, so they could not use their phone and laptop together. |
| 4 | User can show that they have an account set up | This step was very straight forward. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Provide at least 3 improvements you believe could be made to the usability of the workflow in question.
1. The website homepage should have a dedicated register button.
2. The confirmation email should be a pin number. This is so the user can access their email on whatever device they want, not just the device they are creating the account on.
3. They used two captcha checks. This could be reduced to one check.
4. The password does not state what makes it a valid password, yet checks certain basic criteria without informing the user.
   
Outline at least 2 experiences in the workflow that you believe were of benefit to the user.
1. Having all of the entered info on a few pages made the process super quick and easy.
2. Forcing the user to set up the two factor authentication is good. This is because many users forget to set this up later.
   
What do you believe your team did well in conducting the usability test?
* I believe our team did well setting up the test because we meshed really well and worked from the home page down making sure to hit every major point we collectively thought of.
  
What could your team improve for next time (hint: there will be a next time)?
Offer a brief statement (no more than several sentences) about your experience conducting a usability test.
* Next time we will know specifically what to look for in the steps of the test itself, so the process should involve less figuring out what the test should be. We will also be able to use feedback on this test to improve the next test to be better.
