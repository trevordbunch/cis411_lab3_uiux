| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1  |  This website pulls more of an effort from the user where they have to read really closely on what is provided. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 |  This website doesn't take long to process things because all is needed is an upload of the resume but it also doesn't have an beneficial tips like Indeed. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  2 | Simplyhired made only one step which was upload the resume and that's it. It was clear but they didn't offer anything else to help the applicant.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 |  This site was overwhelming because it wasn't as simple to find what specifically was needed. They didn't give an option to search for stay at home jobs or remote option. But it was able to give specific job names similar to ones that are searched. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 |   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1  | This site wasn't really effective because of how much was needed to be read in order to navigate through what you wanted to find.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  |  This site seems like its more effective on mouse-less interface because of how simple and straight to the function of the site. |
| **TOTAL** |  13 |   |

## Step 3.5 Findings

### Improvements
1. Discord could give the option of making an account through an online desktop easier but it navigates the user to get the application.
2. Something that can help users who are foreign to the application is details on the benefits and navigation of it.
3. Needs better navigation so that Users know where to go to make groups and add friends.

### Experiences
1. Quick and easy to fill out mobile.
2. Complicated to navigate after creating account because wasn't familiar with the application.

### Team
- My team did well in coming up with the right suggestions on what do when confronting the application.
- Next time the team can be more elaborate in the steps to take for those who aren't technically savvy.

### My Experience

- My experience with conduction the User was easy but complicated because I had to adjust my vocabulary to make the User understand better. This was helpful to know what to do for our application in the future because the entire campus will be using the application, not just computer science majors. The navigation was complicated on what to do and where to do it because I wasn't even sure where things were because I couldn't understand the icons.
