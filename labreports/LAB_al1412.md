# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | User creating an 8-semester plan |
| Description / Steps | Messiah student creates and saves their 8-semester plan |
| Primary Actor | User (Messiah student) |
| Preconditions | User signs in to application through CAS system <br> User selects courses they wish to take for a certain semester and drags them to their semester of choice <br> User has no errors relating to their course schedule <br> User hits the save button after finalizing their changes |
| Postconditions | User is able to sign back in later to find their saved course plan <br> User is able to change their plan at any time |

## Step 3.2 Identify a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1: [ECARPS](http://huggs.messiah.edu/ecarps/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in as a guest to the application  |   |
| 2 | Specify your major  | Choose your major from a list of engineering majors (and minors)  |
| 3 | Rearrange courses to match the 8-semester plan  |   |
| 4 | Add desired courses to the respective semester schedule  |   |
| 5 | If necessary, fix errors associated with scheduling  |   |
| 6 | Save all work, then sign out  |   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in as a guest to the application  | Log in process was very easy, all user had to do was pass captcha proving that they were not a robot  |
| 2 | Specify your major  | Basic process, in addition to selecting majors and minors there is also an option indicating if a student is part of the honors program  |
| 3 | Rearrange courses to match the 8-semester plan  | Required general education courses are indicated in a red outline, there is no problems when selecting a major, but selecting a minor causes some problems since the user is on the default engineering schedule  |
| 4 | Add desired courses to the respective semester schedule  | The system does not give specific errors when moving classes, so it was up to the user to figure out which class was causing the problem.  |
| 5 | If necessary, fix errors associated with scheduling  | Since the system did not give an error for a specific class placement, it took a while for the user to figure out which class was causing the error and how to arrange the scheduling to fix it.  |
| 6 | Save all work, then sign out  | Guest users cannot save their schedules, but each semester has a "Save Notes" button at the end with a text bar next to it for the user to put notes in, which saves when the user refreshes the page, but doesn't save if they are signed out and sign in again.  |

## Step 3.5 Findings
**Improvements to be made:**    
1. Change the design of how courses are shown on the page (change the course list's layout).   
2. Add a function to filter and/or search through courses as desired.   
3. Fix red flags with a first time sign in with a minor selection.   

**Beneficial experiences to the user:**    
1. Having the pre-made plan from the start    
2. Having all major requirements in one place    
3. Pre-requisite flagging    

**Things our group did well:**    
Asked questions about how the user felt and how they were doing at certain points in the process    

**Things we could have improved upon:**    
Getting someone that has never heard of the ECARPS system before, so that it could be tested from a different perspective   

**Statement about test conducting experience:**    
The test helped us to make an outline of what we wanted so that we could get better information if we asked for unprompted feedback. However, conducting a test which matched our desired product turned out to be an issue, as we could not test certain functions such as signing out and signing back in, mainly for guest users.
