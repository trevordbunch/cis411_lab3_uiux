## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Site 1 | Score 1 | Summary 1 |
| Site 2 | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |1   | The website felt easy to use, however, one of the main things I want from a job site is to filter results. I looked for about 5 minutes and cannot find a way to filter results. With search queries that display many different jobs, the only way to go through the results in by manually looking at each one. ![](../assets/Jobs%20search%20results.png)*Search results on Jobs.com for 'computer science' in Mifflinburg, PA.* |
| 2. **User are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | I was able to sign-up and start searching for specific jobs within a minute of accessing this website. I could easily skip through portions of their sign-up as I desired.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | They prioritize the wrong information which leads to the job title being cutoff. They cannot control the job information, but almost all of the jobs titles are cutoff because of their improper spacing.   ![](../assets/Jobs%20whitespace.png)*Job search result with cutoff text*  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | The sign-up process felt extremely easy to use because they worked everything out step by step. ![](../assets/jobs%20signup.png) *Jobs.com sign-up page.*  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | Jobs.com seems to use the correct amount of words to explain everything they had to, while also using logos as much as possible. The screenshot included is the most word filled part of their website (besides the job description page), and it feels like they designed it correctly. ![](../assets/Jobs%20omit.png) *Jobs.com's website footer.* |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | There is no navigation features on their website, all of the options are either logos or icons that are not directly related to navigation. ![](../assets/Jobs%20navigation.png) *Jobs.com job search page with little to no navigational features.* |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  |There is a large image that serves as the background for this homepage. This makes it fairly difficult to navigate. The rest of the website was fine, worked without CSS enabled, and functioned with only keyboard input. ![](../assets/Jobs%20high%20contrast.png) *The look of Jobs.com with high contrast mode on.*|
| **TOTAL** |   |   |
