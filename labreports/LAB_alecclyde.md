# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Site 1 | 16 | Jobs.com has a clean website, but sometimes the website becomes too clean, leading to the user becoming lost with the lack of navigation direction. They also lack features that can extend the time the user has to spend looking for jobs. |
| Site 2 | 20 | Indeed.com has a little more of a cluttered website, but not by much more. The extra clutter comes from the added features they provide over Jobs.com. The user should never feel lost within this website, as they are really navigating between 2 to 3 pages typically. |

## 2.2 Site 1

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |1   | The website felt easy to use, however, one of the main things I want from a job site is to filter results. I looked for about 5 minutes and cannot find a way to filter results. With search queries that display many different jobs, the only way to go through the results in by manually looking at each one. ![](../assets/Jobs%20search%20results.png)*Search results on Jobs.com for 'computer science' in Mifflinburg, PA.* |
| 2. **User are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | I was able to sign-up and start searching for specific jobs within a minute of accessing this website. I could easily skip through portions of their sign-up as I des ired.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | They prioritize the wrong information which leads to the job title being cutoff. They cannot control the job information, but almost all of the jobs titles are cutoff because of their improper spacing.   ![](../assets/Jobs%20whitespace.png)*Job search result with cutoff text*  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | The sign-up process felt extremely easy to use because they worked everything out step by step. ![](../assets/jobs%20signup.png) *Jobs.com sign-up page.*  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | Jobs.com seems to use the correct amount of words to explain everything they had to, while also using logos as much as possible. The screenshot included is the most word filled part of their website (besides the job description page), and it feels like they designed it correctly. ![](../assets/Jobs%20omit.png) *Jobs.com's website footer.* |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | There is no navigation features on their website, all of the options are either logos or icons that are not directly related to navigation. I felt stuck on the page I was on. ![](../assets/Jobs%20navigation.png) *Jobs.com job search page with little to no navigational features.* |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  |There is a large image that serves as the background for this homepage. This makes it fairly difficult to navigate. The rest of the website was fine, worked without CSS enabled, and functioned with only keyboard input. ![](../assets/Jobs%20high%20contrast.png) *The look of Jobs.com with high contrast mode on.*|
| **TOTAL** |16   |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | Indeed made a good website that allows selections and preferences to be made intuitively. ![](../assets/Indeed%20Search%20options.png) *Indeed.com search results, many different result filter preferences.*   |
| 2. **User are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | Indeed allowed me to search for a job as a guest without needing to sign-up for an account, which would have taken more time.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |2   | Indeed has a fairly clean site, but does put a little clutter down below the clean information. Overall, they seem to streamline the information displayed. ![](../assets/Indeed%20Billboard.png)*Indeed.com homepage search.*  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |Indeed did a great job at leading me though the sign-up process, step by step. ![](../assets/Indeed%20Sign-up.png) *Indeed.com sign-up page.* |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | Indeed uses as few words as possible while also conveying as much information as possible. ![](../assets/Indeed%20Search%20description.png) *Indeed.com job selection and description.*  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | Indeed has a static menu bar at the top of the page at all times that will take the user where they need to go. Indeed also has buttons and kebab menu's where handy to keep navigation panes from becoming cluttered.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | Indeed looks incredibly accessible using high contrast and while having CSS turned off. Indeed also has a site where people who need accessibility can go to check the support of their website with accessibility standards. ![](../assets/Indeed%20Accessability%20.png) *Accessibility site from Indeed.com* |
| **TOTAL** |20 |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Sign up for an event. |
| Description / Steps |A user will search and sign up for an event, filtering results as needed.  |
| Primary Actor |User |
| Preconditions |User must have account with the website. |
| Postconditions |Sign-up process is logged with event site and with user. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors:
1. Competitor 1: [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)
2. Competitor 2: [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
3. Competitor 3: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |Use search to query for an event.   |The user should use search-bar to discover an event.   |
| 2 |Choose desired event.   | User should parse through events, filtering as needed, to find desired event.  |
| 3 |Use event page to find more information about event.   |This page should confirm to the user whether the event is what they thought it was from search results.   |
| 4 |Register for event.  | If user desides they want to sign-up for event, the sign-up method should be on event page.  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |Use search to query for an event.   |The user looked for the search bar, and then once they found it, searched for the event they wanted.   |
| 2 | Choose desired event.  | The user event came right up at the top of the search results, no need for discovering events.  |
| 3 |	Use event page to find more information about event.   | The user was easily able to see that the selected event was what they thought it would be.  |
| 4 | Register for event.  |The user clicked a button and was able to sign up in less than 20 seconds.   |

## Step 3.5 Findings
The user **did like being able to register for an event in one click, using the saved information about themselves to sign-up. The search also provided the results they thought it would, and there was no need to filter results. 

The user did **not** like how there were no related or suggested results to chose from, the search was very literal and strict.

Overall the process of signing up for an event on meetup.com was incredibly easy for the user. The event did not require much more information to sign-up, so that made the registration process incredibly easy. 

# Extra Credit
**Use user's muscle memory to your advantage.**

Users are used to selecting the search bar at the top, the menu off to the left, and the logo to go back to the landing page up top. Use these common internet conventions to make navigating your website easy. If you try changing all of these to "stand apart from the rest," there is a good chance users will get frustrated at the fact that the website is not functioning as expected.
