## 2.2 Site 1
### Linkedin
- #### [main page](https://www.linkedin.com/home)
![Linkedin main page](/assets/linkedin1.png)
I like that this page is simple and the difference between the option of signing up and creating an account is very clear.
- #### [sign in form](https://www.linkedin.com/login?fromSignIn=true&trk=guest_homepage-basic_nav-header-signin)
![Linkedin sign in form](/assets/linkedin2.png)
The form is very simple and is what would be expected of a sign in form
- #### [feed page](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)
![Linkedin feed](/assets/linkedin3.png)
I like that the content is separated into my profile, my feed, and Linkedin news which makes it easy to navigate.
- #### [profile page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammanueltamrat/)
![Linkedin profile page](/assets/linkedin4.png)
- #### [skills section](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammanueltamrat/)

![Linkedin profile page add skill](/assets/linkedin6.png)
- #### [job search](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammanueltamrat/)

I like that the search bar is always present which makes searching very intuitive
- #### [search results](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=software%20developer%20internship&origin=AUTO_COMPLETE&position=4&searchId=70b7e647-f831-459b-bfe3-36121ec6e05b&sid=lHl)
![Linkedin job search results](/assets/linkedin8.png)
I like that there is an option to save jobs on the spot. I also like that relevant information like the location and the presence of alumni from the same school is given to help sort through the results.
- #### [job page](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=2966432860&keywords=software%20developer%20internship)
![Linkedin selected job page](/assets/linkedin9.png)
I like that the apply button is the only brightly colored one.

## 2.3 Site 2
### Glassdoor
- #### [main page](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)
![glassdoor main page](/assets/glassdoor1.png)
The form to create an account looks like a sign-in form. I would put the option to sign in and create an account next to each other to make it less ambiguous.
- #### [sign in](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)
![glassdoor sign in form](/assets/glassdoor2.png)
The sign-in form is what you would expect.
- #### [add resume page](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/uploadResume.htm?userValidationKey=Pyhpiko%3AJ7MyttFnc6ODZPTZ2JcJw&completedAction=VALIDATED)
![glassdoor add resume page](/assets/glassdoor3.png)
It's nice to be able to upload a resume to autofill some of the profile information.
- #### [profile page](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/index.htm?profileOrigin=UPLOAD_RESUME&resumeOriginHook=MANAGE_RESUME)
![glassdoor profile page](/assets/glassdoor4.png)
I like that the profile page is split up into intuitive sections and is intuitive to navigate
- #### [skill section](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/index.htm?profileOrigin=UPLOAD_RESUME&resumeOriginHook=MANAGE_RESUME)
![glassdoor profile page skill section](/assets/glassdoor5.png)

- #### [add skill form](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/index.htm?profileOrigin=UPLOAD_RESUME&resumeOriginHook=MANAGE_RESUME)
![glassdoor profile page add skill form](/assets/glassdoor6.png)
- #### [job search](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/index.htm?profileOrigin=UPLOAD_RESUME&resumeOriginHook=MANAGE_RESUME)

- #### [job posting](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?context=Jobs&clickSource=searchBox&locId=1152196&locT=C&sc.keyword=Software%20Developer%20Intern)
![glassdoor job posting](/assets/glassdoor8.png)
I like that salary information is posted. I also like the presence of information like ratings and reviews. I wish that it would state if a position is remote or in person.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | The site is very intuitive however the ambiguity between the sign-in and create account forms is confusing.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | I was only forced to take necessary steps and no more. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  2 | There is alot of information on the main page which can drown out the important information.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | The calls to action, like the brightly colored buttons are very effective at drawing my attention to what I am supposed to be doing.  |

| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  The navigation was very intuitive, every step led me to the desired page. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 |  The most important information is in text form which is accessible to screen readers and all the steps can be taken without a mouse. |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 ||
|---|---|
| Title | Finding The Campus Map |
| Description / Steps | 1. The user opens the app. <br> 2. The user log into the app <br> 3. The users presses "Campus map" tab. |
| Primary Actor | Messiah University Student|
| Preconditions | 1. The user must have a valid messiah university email <br> 2. The user have the app downloaded |
| Postconditions | 1. The campus map is displayed on the screen <br> 2. The system gives the option to return to the home page|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Falcon Link](https://falconlink.webapps.messiah.edu/)
2. Competitor 2 [Messiah Website](https://www.messiah.edu/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Opening the messiah website  |   |
| 2 | Searching for the map  | Users can use the search bar or navigate through the website  |
| 3 | Selecting the right result  |   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Opening the messiah website  |   |
| 2 | Searching for the map  | - The user tried clicking on the map icon but could not find a map on the resulting page. <br> - The user also tried to go to the about page and could not find the map. <br> - The user finally found the map in the bottom navigation section of the website  |
| 3 | Selecting the right result  | - The user liked that the campus map is up to date <br> - The user did not like that the map changes between a realistic map and an animated one as it was confusing <br> - The user did not like that the map did not have labels <br> - The user did not like that map does not bring up results if there is a typo in the search|

## Step 3.5 Findings
- Improvements that I beleive could be made:
  - The map icon does not lead to a page with a map. I would add a map to the linked page as users would expect one.
  - The user had a hard time navigating using the navigation bar at the top of the website. I would add icons and more descriptive titles so that users have the right expectations when clicking a link.
  - I would add an indicator of where the user is as navigating the pages on a phone can be confusing.<br>

- Experiences in the workflow that I  believe were of benefit to the user: 
  - The presence of a search bar helps the user in navigating the website.
  - The content is not too overwhelming as there is a descent amount of whitespace between the different texts.<br>


- I beleive that expressing our observations and discussing them as a team was something that our team did well in conducting the usability test.
- We could have asked more questions to the user about what improvments they would like to see.
- Conducting a usability test was a good experience seeing how other people navigate systems. In particular it helped me realize how the design can have an impact on how users use the product. In the future I will use usability test to make sure that my designs are providing the best user experience.
