# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |  
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 19| Indeed was a very well set up website to look for jobs. I was able to search job posting by date posted, if the job was in person or remote, how far from my house or town of residency. I was also able to choose if I wanted a full time, part time or internship, location and company. Each of the refinements made it easier for me to search jobs. I did not have to have an account with Indeed to search for jobs which I found to be very nice.|  
| Ziprecruiter | 15 | Ziprecruiter was an okay website that allows users to search specific jobs or search a location for all jobs available. I was asked several times to create an account and/or add my email address before searching for jobs which I found to be frustrating. Each time I looked up Ziprecruiter I was given a different home page which was confusing to me. |

## 2.2 Site 1 Indeed.com
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3  |  The website was very easy to use. I was able to search based on jobs I was looking for as well as by location. ![SearchArea](/assets/SearchArea.png) I searched for jobs in Lancaster PA|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time? | 3 | I was able to search for jobs as soon as I was on the website. No log in was required to search for jobs. This process was very easy and did not take very long to accomplish. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 |  Indeed allows users to customize the search results for what they are looking for which is very helpful. They allow users to search based on the categories listed at the top of the screen. ![SearchArea](/assets/SearchArea.png) This image shows how users can search for jobs. I searched for internships in Lancaster PA.![Job](/assets/Job.png) When you search jobs this is how they are displayed. I then clicked on a job that interested me and was given more information if I wanted to apply. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  3 | When you return to the website you can log in to your profile which allows the user to access their profile, check messages and other features. ![LogIn](/assets/LogIn.png) This is the login page for Indeed. ![Profile](/assets/Profile.png) This image shows a users profile page.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  |  Indeed.com uses the correct of amount of words to explain their features and different pages on their website. I think at times Indeed could use more words but it is not necessary. ![Footer](/assets/Footer.png) This image is the footer of Indeed's website. I feel that is sufficient but more words could be added for clarity. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | I feel that Indeed has good navigation features on their website. They have a combination of words and images to show users different pages and features on their website.  ![Header](/assets/Header.png) This image is the header of Indeed.com and I feel that it has appropriate word usage to convey the different pages on their website. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | When you search Indeed.com you are given a webpage with the an aea to search for jobs and also by location. I think the ads on the page can be distracting and/or irrelevant to job searching. ![Homepage](/assets/Homepage.png) |
| **TOTAL** |  19 | Overall Indeed.com is a very good website to search for jobs. The application process seems very easy, it allows users to go navigate to the website of the job they are applying for which I find to be very helpful. I would definitely use this app to look for internships, full time and part time work since it was very esa to navigate and use. |

## 2.3 Site 2 Ziprecruiter
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  1 |  Ziprecruiter has a website that I find hard to navigate. There are no spots where I can refine searches which is frustrating. Each time I searched for this site I was given homepages and some of he features were in different spots. This became very frustrating for me. ![Homepage_ZR](/assets/Homepage_ZR.png) This image is the homepage for Ziprecruiter. ![Homepage2_ZR](/assets/Homepage2_ZR.png) This image is also the homepage for Ziprecruiter. Each time I searched Ziprecuiter.com I received different homepages. This is frustrating as a user.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time? | 2  |  When I went to search for an IT help desk job in Lancaster, PA it wanted me to input my email before locating any jobs. I was able to move forward without creating an account or inputting my email but it is annoying that each time you enter the site you have to click off that to search jobs. It took me longer to search fo jobs and see job listings for my area. I feel that I spent too much time clicking no for my email address than actually looking for jobs. ![Searching_ZR](/assets/Searching_ZR.png) |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  |  At the top of the page after you search it allows users to refine the search which is a nice feature. Overall I think that it is a nice a site to search for jobs. ![JobSearch_ZR](/assets/JobSearch_ZR.png)  ![Features_ZR](/assets/Features_ZR.png) |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2 |  The log-in process is very difficult to navigate. Users have to find the sign in tab and once they find it they have to find the "create an account button." I do not feel that it is straight forward at all which is frustrating. To create an account you have to answer a series of questions which are shown in the image below. ![LogIn_ZR](/assets/LogIn_ZR.png) This image shows the page where users will create an account. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |  The bottom of the website page has several useful pages that users are able to click on to gather more information about the site as well as other features. I think that Ziprecruiter uses the correct about of words to convey the messages they want to. ![Footer_ZR](/assets/Footer_ZR.png) This image shows the footer at the bottom of the Ziprecuiter website. ![Header_ZR](/assets/Header_ZR.png) This image shows the header at the top of page and the different pages the site offers. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2 |  The navigation of Ziprecuiter is interesting. The home page and job searching page are great - they allow users to navigate easily with the features at the top of the page. When a user wants to apply for a job it automatically takes them to LinkedIn. Some Ziprecruiter users might not have a LinkedIn account which can make this step challenging for users. ![Applying_ZR](/assets/Applying_ZR.png) This image shows the LinkedIn page you are taken to when you want to apply for a job. ![Applying2_ZR](/assets/Applying2_ZR.png) This image shows the process a user will go through on LinkedIn to apply for the job they chose.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | I feel that overall the site is hard to access. There were many steps that I needed to skip over just to look for jobs. I was asked several times about signing up for an account and inputting my email just so I could look at jobs which I found to be very annoying. I think that the use and ease of this website cou dbe improved. |
| **TOTAL** |  15 |  Overall the website was not the best. As previously mentioned there were some challenges to using this website. There are definitely improvements that should be made. It took me more time to locate features and navigate the website than I did looking for jobs. I think that Ziprecruiter could make some improvements to better their website and maybe gain more users. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 Daylio

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create an account and profile. | To create an account first download the app onto your personal device. Next you will want to open the app where you will be given a series of questions. Make sure to click "skip" for creating a goal at this time as we will do this later. After those pages you will be given a screen to customize your emojis you want to use and the color scheme you would like to have. |
| 2 | Create a goal that you want to work towards, remember to keep the goal realistic. | To create a goal you will want to access the stats page, to get to this page click the "stats" button at the bottom of the page, it will be the second tab on the bottom of the screen from the left. You will scroll down a little on this page until you see goals and create a goal. Click on create a goal. At this point you will be given a page where the user can create the goal. You can choose how often you want to be reminded of the goal and what days you reminded. |
| 3 | Log your moods for the past 3 days, remember to be honest about your moods as this information is here to help you. | To log you mood for the current day or a previous say click the " + " sign at the bottom of the screen in teh middle. Then choice what day you want to track your mood. You can add your emoji for your mood. |
| 4 |  Check your mood count to see how your moods were though the past several days. |  To check your mood count go to the stats page which is the second icon to the left of the screen at the bottom of the page. You will see a section that says "mood count" click on that and it will show you your moods for the past week. This allows users to see how their mood has been over the past several days.|
| 5 |  Access your weekly report to see how your week has been. | To access the weekly report you will want to locate the three dots on the bottom of your screen on the right hand side. Click on the three dots and this will being up a new page. You will see a section that says "weekly report" click on that and now you have found the weekly reports section and can vie your stats for the week. This feature is nice since it allows users to see all their stats for that week. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Create an account and profile. |  The user was able to cerate the account easily and they did not struggle with anything during this process. |
| 2 |  Create a goal that you want to work towards, remember to keep the goal realistic. | The user  navigated to the " + " sign as they thought that was how to add a goal. They quickly realized that was wrong. The user navigated to the stats page where they were able to create a goal for themselves. This step took the user some time to accomplish. |
| 3 |  Log your moods for the past 3 days, remember to be honest about your moods as this information is here to help you. | The user quickly navigated to the " + " sign and was able to track their mood for the current day and a few previous days. The user did not struggle with this process at all. |
| 4 | Check your mood count to see how your moods were though the past several days. | The user quickly navigated to the stats page where they were able to locate the mood count section. They looked through their mood chart and were able to see how they were feeling throughout the week. The user did not have any problems completing this step. |
| 5 | Access your weekly report to see how your week has been. | This step took the user some time to find their weekly report. They assumed it was on the stats page and quickly navigated to that page but found out that it was not located in that section. They then navigated to the three dots on the bottom of the page and found their weekly report. THe user was able to see all their stats for the week on this report. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Organize your findings here.
Provide at least 3 improvements you believe could be made to the usability of the workflow in question.
- I would change the way the user can view their weekly report. Based on our experience users have a difficult time locating this feature. I think it would be better placed on the stats page where the rest of the reports and stats are located.
- I would also recommend allowing users to get multiple notifications throughout the day. During our experience users wanted that an option but that was not available at this current time.
- The last thing we would improve is allowing users to set multiple goals. The user wanted to add more than 1 goal to work on but was unable to do so without purchasing the premium version of the app. 

Outline at least 2 experiences in the workflow that you believe were of benefit to the user.
- Allowing users to input their mood for a previous say was a very nice feature. I think that it is a smart feature to have because sometimes our days get busy and we forget to input data so allowing the users to do so was really nice. 
- Another feature I thought was a benefit was the mood count. This feature allowed users to see how their mood was throughout the week. I personally really like this feature. I think users would appreciate to see how their week was in terms fo their mood.

What do you believe your team did well in conducting the usability test?
- For not knowing how the app worked or ever using it before. I think that our use case was sufficient and detailed for our knowledge of the app. I think that we were able to get a simple use case created for this app without too much trouble which was a positive thing. 

What could your team improve for next time (hint: there will be a next time)?
- Since no one in our group was familiar with Daylio it was challenging to create a use case. With not knowing much about the app we made things very simple. Moving forward especially when we create a use cade for our own app we can be more detailed in steps and the process to complete those steps.

Offer a brief statement (no more than several sentences) about your experience conducting a usability test.
- Overall I think that the user had a positive experience using the app and completing the steps we had in our use case. The user did struggle with some the steps we wanted them to complete which did become frustrating for the user.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
- Use the Users History to your Advantage
    - The user will most likely navigate to the same pages of an app or a website. Keep a tab of each of their interactions and have a page that they can easily navigate to so they can locate a page easier. If the user always goes to the weekly reports tap (as used in our example earlier) allow them to go to their history page and get to the reports page that way. By adding this feature users can obtain the information they want mch faster and it will not waste their time.
