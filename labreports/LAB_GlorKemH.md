## Step 3.1 Product Use Case
 
| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Personnel Contacts |
| Description / Steps 
|
Internally, navigate to the event page in our app to find people willing to play for your event within the area.  Externally, people can scour social media platforms for people who play instrumentments, find their social media handles, then share their event with them through the app.  
Navigate to the event’s primary page to share worship events to social media in order to gain more attention or share worship events with specific people on social media to gather more attention.
Establish connections between team members through messaging.  This would involve a messaging feature somewhere on the app.
Add people to a created worship event.
Navigate to the messaging page, which will allow you to message your team members for the event.   
|
| Primary Actor |Individual user engaged with the app |
| Preconditions 
|
*Event leader has to download the app
*Event leader has to create an account
*Event leader has to connect social media handles to their account.  
|
| Postconditions 
|
*People who were reached out to can either accept the invitation or decline. 
*Then, they will download the app and make an account to be put into the event.  
*Once they’ve downloaded the app and make an account, they’ll have access to the event materials and internal messaging features.

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product
List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Services](https://www.planningcenter.com/services)
2. Competitor 2 [VesselWorship](https://www.vesselworship.org/)
 
## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test
 
| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creating an account |
* The steps the user must go through to create their account. Registration/Login, possible email verification.
|
| 2 | Creating a team |
	*Adding team members to your team
	*Gathering team members info
	*Communicating with them
|
| 3 | Creating a service |
	*Setting a time for the service
	*Setting a date for a service
	*Selecting team members/roles for the service.
 
## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions
 
| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creating an account  | 
*Confusion with confirmation placeholder
*After selecting your role, it gave an option to add people or services, but this wasn’t intuitive and he didn’t really know what this part wanted him to do so he skipped it
*On the home page, there was text that made it seem like you were locked in being just a leader, but in reality there are other roles that you can be.
  
|
| 2 | Creating a team |  
*He tried to search for people he wants to add to his team.  When this search was unsuccessful, he realized that you first have to 
manually create profiles for your team members, then add these to your team.  This was not intuitive from the start
*From the teams page, android’s back button did not function as intended
*Some buttons are off-center when you press the team tab when you’re on the team page. 
*He doesn’t know where to find the people that he’s added on the team page.  He tried adding a person, but now he can’t find where that person is.
*Design is not intuitive at all, probably requires organizational training for anyone to use it. 
|
| 3 | Creating a service | 
*When creating a service, he felt confused because he kept clicking the date that he wanted his service be on and then when he tried to create the service, it wouldn’t let him.  He quickly realized that the service time looked like it was set because of the placeholder text’s color but it wasn’t, which is why it wasn’t letting him create his service.
*When this was happening, there wasn’t any feedback about what he was doing wrong, it just highlighted the box red.

Signup Clarity, Beneficial Feedback, Streamlined Communication
 
## Step 3.5 Findings
Prove at least 3 improvements that can be made to usability/workflow
Sign-up Clarity: 
Add simple confirmations like “Your email is invalid” or “You left ‘x’ field blank”.
More accurate placeholder text that describes what they want the user to do better.
Beneficial Feedback: 
When creating a service, giving more specific feedback about what the user is doing wrong.
Creating a basic tutorial for first-time users.
Streamlined Communication
The main form of communication in this app as it stands now is mass emails to every team member.
A solution to this is utilizing instant messaging capabilities like an in-app group chat or channel of some kind.  
Outline at least 2 experiences in the usability/workflow that were beneficial
All the team managing features we were looking for were present and this app was the best competitor that we found, which was helpful because it took a while to find an app that was like ours.
There was a dark mode and it overall had a clean aesthetic even though all the functionality wasn’t there.
What do you believe your team did well in conducting a usability test?
We tried to see ourselves as one of our personas or an average user for the app instead of as a very experienced software user.
We did a good job at breaking down the app into its three main functions, expressing the primary avenues a user will go down.  
Offer a brief statement about your experience conducting a usability test.
Conducting a usability test really opened our eyes into how we will need to develop our app’s ui. Based on what we noticed in our competitor, it will be very important to have a clean design that ensures an intuitive user journey without tremendous roadblocks.
