# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Checking Chapel Credits |
| Description / Steps | 1. Locate and click on the Chapel Attendance module. 2. If necessary, log in again for reauthentication. 3. Click on "Show Details" to view chapel attendance dates and associated card scanner numbers.  |
| Primary Actor | Student |
| Preconditions |  Student must have an authenticated and active Messiah account. |
| Postconditions | Student knows how many chapel credits they have, and how many they still need. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

Only one real competitor or adjacent tool:

[FalconLink](falconlink.webapps.messiah.edu/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Usability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log into FalconLink. | The browser may already be logged in if it was used with an account recently. |
| 2 | Find and click on the module for checking chapel credits. | Chapel Attendance is the proper module, not Chapel Schedule or Personal Information (which also shows up when "chapel" is searched) |
| 3 | Log in again. | The user may be required to reauthenticate themselves at this time as they redirected to a different page. |
| 4 | Click on "Show Details" to see the dates of chapels. | For some reason this refreshes the page and gives the numbers associated with the card scanner used. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log into FalconLink. | The user seemed to be able to log in relatively well, but noted that some elements were spaced oddly on mobile. |
| 2 | Find and click on the module for checking chapel credits. | The user felt the filters were unclear, unhelpful, and took up too much of the screen. They also were slightly confused about why "Personal Information" showed up when the finally searched for "chapel". |
| 3 | Log in again. | The user was able to log in fine, but confused why they needed to reauthenticate themselves so soon after. |
| 4 | Click on "Show Details" to see the dates of chapels. | Could figure out what they were reading eventually, but confused by the large amounts of empty space and the small text. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Through the usability test, we gained valuable insights into the user experience and identified areas for improvement. The following summarizes our findings and recommendations:


Suggested improvements:
   1. Optimize the layout and design for mobile devices to ensure proper spacing and readability.
   2. Improve the search filters to make it easier for users to find relevant modules without confusion.
   3. Streamline the authentication process to minimize the need for reauthentication, especially during the same session.

Beneficial experiences:
   1. Users were able to successfully log in to FalconLink and access the Chapel Attendance module.
   2. The "Show Details" option provided useful information on chapel attendance dates.

Our team's performance:
   1. We effectively identified issues with the mobile layout, search filters, and reauthentication process.
   2. For future tests, we should provide more detailed instructions and tasks for users to explore a wider range of functionalities within the app.

Overall, the usability test was an enlightening experience, enabling us to pinpoint areas for enhancement to ensure that students can efficiently access the information they need. We will use these insights to refine the user experience and make the necessary improvements to the app.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)

**Rule: Prioritize Clarity and Simplicity**

The importance of maintaining clarity and simplicity in a website or application's design cannot be overstated. Users should be able to navigate effortlessly and find the information they are looking for without getting overwhelmed by excessive visual elements or complicated features. An uncomplicated design not only reduces the cognitive load on users but also helps them accomplish their tasks more efficiently. By focusing on clarity and simplicity, designers can create an intuitive user experience that caters to a wide range of users, regardless of their technical proficiency. When users can seamlessly interact with a website or application, their overall satisfaction and trust in the platform increase, leading to higher user retention and positive word-of-mouth.
