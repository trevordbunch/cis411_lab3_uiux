# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkIn | 14 | While this has more features, it also is a bit crowded/noisy due to that. Furthermore, the added details, while contributing to validity, complicate the processes of the "Search" |
| Indeed | 16 | A streamlined "Search" for jobs that offer little to no Networking associations |

## 2.2 Site 1

### LinkedIn
#### Steps
Account was already created in advance
<br>

![Sign In](../assets/LinkedIn/One/SignIn1.png)
![Pt2](../assets/LinkedIn/One/SignIn2.png)

1. Navigate to site and login
   - Logging in is easy because of the information saved after logging out. However, the fact that saved information sign in is different than the regular sign in is confusing, especially since the regular sign in also contains a link to a third-party service sign in as well as the usual sign up area.

2. Navigating to profile is easy, but the amount of pop-up views is a bit of a nuisance.

3. Added skill, though I couldn't decide which one to add, so I used Chess as an example of tactical strength.

4. To apply for a job is not easy, even if we are not required to complete the application, due to the fact that it feels wrong to apply for something you don't want to do regardless of it being a hypothetical.

5. Settings change is a good feature, but for me doing this lab, I'd rather not

6. Links to external site, checked with other applications, they are the same.


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | Intuitive for jobs, yes, but Profile login is just a little confusing, and how skills are listed and tested is something else |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 |  Definitely quick to link to another site, matches job skills with job listings |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | Not the best, to be honest, first theirs the central alignment of three sections they think would interest you, then there is the selection of looking into more detail. The alignment changes from a center based scroll feed to that of left-right, but description of the job is underneath an overall summary block|
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  |  Yep  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  | If talking of the different backlinks towards one specific feature, than there are multiple ways, however most of them aren't redundant, the message section that is a pop-up does appear even when the message in the navigation bar is selected though. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1  | In jobs, once you're looking at details the scroll bar for the div looks almost identical to the background color behind it. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | In some aspects it is easier to navigate the website via touchscreen, the scrolling of the job description does not involve looking for the scroll bar because you can touch and drag. However, it also seems to register as trying to scroll down the whole webpage rather than a specific division more often than not.  |
| **TOTAL** | 14  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

![Pt 5](../assets/Indeed/One/SignUp5.png)



1. Navigate to site and registered
   - I used my google account, but one of the steps was repetatitve
   - If they are logging us in via Google account, shouldn't they know the First and Last name, or can't they ask permission to get the information?
   - The required Title desired leaves much to <strong>be</strong> desired.

2. Profile building was long... and kind of pointless with repeat things to skip

3. It's easy to tell that the main focus of the site is solely job hunting, that being said... If I were to judge LinkIn in comparison to this I would take back a few complaints on the divider's placement there. Here it's building itself like Pinterest.

4. To apply for a job is fairly easy with the set up here. This time they saved information from Personal profile, so that's good.



| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | Intuitive on the Job aspect, but profile build is sort of annoying if you don't know where your starting to look  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Very short and concise |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | Yes, but there is spacing issues, crowding of information with Job Search, but also too much spacing when signing up  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | Yep, even if it was a little annoying  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  | Fairly careful, though the repeat of asking for name when using a google signup makes me suspect that the form only connects the email to start out with, though I'm not entirely sure.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | Linear, until you search for a job, then the flow is verticle. A little different with the job results and search  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | It's fine with the touchscreen, but it's not like there is much for the controller to need fine detailing for  |
| **TOTAL** |  16 |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Listing item |
| Description / Steps | 1. User clicks on ```sell``` <br>2. Selects category for listed item type <br>3. uploads images of selected merchandise <br>4. User adds in title, description and price <br>5. User reviews listed information of item and submits it for others viewing via ```post ```|
| Primary Actor | Messiah Student (Current, former) |
| Preconditions | 1. Obtained Messiah Authenticated Account <br>2. Application User Profile is logged in <br>3. Holds an Item to list along with photos and a description in mind|
| Postconditions | Item listed for sale uploaded|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/)
2. Competitor 2 [Craigs List](https://harrisburg.craigslist.org)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Navigate to Facebook Marketplace | Easily done through scrolling down in profile, far right icon in Nav Menu |
| 2 | Login/Create account  | Saved information logged in already done so in Facebook App |
| 3 |  Find lawn mower for sale  |  Used search in top bar |
| 4 |  Save selected item on listings | Easy to save, not on listings, counted as a save action in the post |
| 5 |  Return to Home Page | Easily done with haste |
| 6 | Navigate to saved listing  | Confusion of named in instructions, confusion on where to find "saved" list, was found in shopping cart on "Saved Posts"  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Navigate to Facebook Marketplace | She went into app quickly, scrolled through to marketplace on profile quickly, typing had to ask Mom to slow down |
| 2 | Login/Create account  | Already logged in  |
| 3 |  Find lawn mower for sale  |  Went in quickly; She saved a random item - electric mixer |
| 4 |  Save selected item on listings | Saved item at details, didn't know what I mean by Listings, (reference step 4 previous plan) |
| 5 |  Return to Home Page | Easily done for her, but returning to saved list was harder. |
| 6 | Navigate to saved listing | No idea where to find it at, used cart and recently saved item, was saved post page. It was in Shopping cart, which was top right tab in the corner of the screen |

## Step 3.5 Findings
<p> Three improvements include, adding a "Saved Items" icon outside of the "Shopping Cart" division, knowledge of terminology used in the app beforehand, as well as a name for "save" on the details of a listed item. Implicitly, the assumption is that the saved item will be on a wish list or something, but it is generally confusing because of how it is grouped with the "shopping cart".</p>
<p> Experiences of benefit are the quickness of being able to navigate between the Market place and the Home page through the Navigation Menu, and the ease of being able to search for an item through tags.</p>
<p> Our team was thorough in specifics of what they wanted to have the usability test on, maybe even a little too specific. </p>
<p> Generality, we spoke of using the word "listings" to save items, and that being written in caused confusion on my part. I ended up speaking of the directions outright, then again, it was a rushed testing due to User probably being busy. </p>
<p> On my part, verbal communication made this a little harder for the test, as well as a need to reinvestigate terminology used in communication due to trying to blur the specifics in instructions to the User in the Test. Though since one term was wrong, and because the user seemed to be in a rush, the "use test" seemed to be more like a race.</p>
