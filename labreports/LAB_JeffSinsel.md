# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [X] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [X] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 18 | The gold standard for job search websites. Easily allows you to sign up and specify different parameters for a job search. Accounts are almost not needed the search is that clean. |
| Snagajob | 15 | Snagajob caters to the niche audience that is hourly workers. It carries on the ever present search bar that Indeed has but sometimes can be cluttered with too much information. |

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |2| The log in could have more contrast  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2 | When not logged in the middle of the home screen is a little clunky  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | Everything that was important was in a blue button  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | As soon as you go onto the site, there is a job search bar |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 | Some "your"s could be removed but overall good |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  The ribbon is always there and organized, and every page leads to a search |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | The site hardly uses the outside thirds, so it would be easy to view on a mobile device  |
| **TOTAL** | 18 |  Overall, great website that could use a little more contrast |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1  | Same search bar idea as indeed but with more things on the home screen, also job seekers and log in being 2 different tabs is slight confusing.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 | Very quick sign up and presents jobs immediately|
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | The information is clear the problem is that steps are obscured by the amount of information on the screen  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  1 |  Gives many options even after signing in as a worker. 8 different section on the logged in home page leading to different paths |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2 |  Pretty good could get rid of "now" in "apply now" |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  Ribbon makes it easy to get around as well as the search bar always being at the top |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | Different aspects of the page are contained in square or rectangular modules that can easily be clicked and moved to fit aspect ratio |
| **TOTAL** | 15  | Performed better than I expected considering the landing page was so busy. The inside of the site was very clean.  |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | ID Balance |
| Description / Steps | User is able to access their dinning dollars in the app and see a breakdown of them <br/> 1. User opens app <br/> 2. User navigates to the dinning sub-app |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | 1. The user has an account <br/> 2. The user is logged into that account|
| Postconditions | 1. The user is able to view their current credits and a breakdown of how much is left |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
- [FalconLink](https://falconlink.webapps.messiah.edu/)
   
## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log in to FalconLink  | Most people are automatically logged into FalconLink  |
| 2 | Find the dinning dollars module  | This is named ID Card Balance which can be confusing  |
| 3 | Find how much the most recent purchase you made was for | The transactions are listed from oldest to newest which can cause a lot of unnecessary scrolling |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log in to FalconLink  | Easy enough considering you have to be logged in to see FalconLink  |
| 2 | Find the dinning dollars module  | My roommate took 4 and a half minutes to finally find the module because he did not look up balance or ID. There are no categories to search through so you simply have to guess the name of the module  |
| 3 | Find how much the most recent purchase you made was for | It took him a couple seconds to pick an option in terms of time in which he picked the longest one not know that he would have to scroll through every single transaction to get ot the most current one  |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Organize your findings here.
1. Provide at least 3 improvements you believe could be made to the usability of the workflow in question.

   1. Providing categories for users to find similar modules
   2. Having a more mobile friendly version of the ID Balance page
   3. Having summary values in the ID Balance page which could include balance and average spending so that you don't have to look through transactions to get values.
   
2.  Outline at least 2 experiences in the workflow that you believe were of benefit to the user.

    1. The log in being mandatory allows for a clear path forward
    2. The mobile version of FalconLink is scaled to be mobile-friendly

3. What do you believe your team did well in conducting the usability test?

    Providing instructions that did not tell the user how to navigate but tells them what to navigate to 

4. What could your team improve for next time (hint: there will be a next time)?

    Communicating more, earlier so that everything can go smoothly and not be rushed

5. Offer a brief statement (no more than several sentences) about your experience conducting a usability test.

    It was a little frustrating not being able to assist the user when they were not understanding certain things. Overall, seeing how other people think is always interesting.
