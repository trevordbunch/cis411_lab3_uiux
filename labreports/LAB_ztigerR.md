# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Site 1 | 19 | Linkedin is a great job search website with an easy to use profile editor and great site navigation. The use of color to highlight important buttons made the task of finding where to go easy. The sites use of pop up windows for edits is nice on a computer sceen but can crowding on a phone screen. |
| Site 2 | 15 | Indeed is a good site for finding a job to apply for but not for applying to the job on that site. There was not an easy way to update my profile on this site. |

## 2.2 Site 1 Linkedin
I have already made a profile on Linkedin

To get to my profile it is two clicks, but the button is very easy to see because it is in a different color.

$~$

There is a small + button to add new skills and job experiances. Skills are simple to add with suggestions based off of your profile and the option to add new skills with user input. With job experiances you need to fill in the fields that they provide.

Job tab in the navbar is easily accessed, or you can use the search bar.
Job selection gives a brief overview of the position, at the botton is a button that you can use to apply for the postion.

This job required contact info that was already filled in from my profile which was nice.

$~$

Then I needed to upload a resume which I also had in my profile but it did not automatic take that one, so I used one from my computer.

Finally after answering some basic job questions there is a final review of your application and a summit button.

No way to apply with Indeed you have to apply on the website so that is where the steps end.

|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | Easy to navigate, found tabs quickly.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1  | If the only way to add new skills is by uploading a new resume is a waste of user time.  |
