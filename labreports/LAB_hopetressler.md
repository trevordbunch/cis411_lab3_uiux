# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 18 | This site was overall very user-friendly and easy to navigate |
| Site 2 | 14 | Overall, this site wasn't the best to use. There were some good qualities to it, however, such as easily finding the job search bar |

## 2.2 Site 1

Site 1: LinkedIn - I had previously created a LinkedIn account

The home page is easy to navigate. There are different options in the bar at the top of the screen, such as Jobs. You can also clearly see your profile.

Searching for a job is simple on LinkedIn. You click the Jobs tab on the navigation bar and have the option to filter out the results. You can add as many filters as you want and the updated results will come in quickly.

![LinkedIn Apply](../assets/LinkedInApply.PNG)
After finding and selecting a job you want to apply for, hit the apply button. This will take you to the company's site and allows you to formally apply for the job. You are able to apply with LinkedIn or do it manually.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | I didn't have any difficulties finding what I wanted to find. For example, the job search area. Everything is simple and easy to find. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | This site valued my time in the way that it was simple to find job recommendations and gave updated results after you refined your job searching criteria.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | I think that LinkedIn is mostly clear, but there is a lot of information immediately given. It may be confusing to find certain things such as the Adding Skills area in the profile section.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1 | There isn't really a path that this site leads you toward. It just gives you things that are focused on what you want and shows the posts of people you follow. LinkedIn is not only a job search site, but a more formal platform for social media. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | I don't think that this site has unnecessary words. Everything seems to be limited and easy for the user to quickly understand the purpose of every feature. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | The workflow seems very effective and this site was easy to navigate. Everything was easy to find, whether it was job searching or posts from connections |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | This site is very accessible to a screen reader. There are no issues from what I can tell and the mobile app is easy to navigate |
| **TOTAL** | 18 | This site was overall very user-friendly and easy to navigate |

## Step 3.5 Findings

#### Improvements 
* Add a way for users to see a rating of each recipe. There are no reviews saying if the recipe is good or not.
* Lessen the amount of filters that show up when user hits the search bar. It can be confusing and overwhelming. 
* Add different ways for users to know what certain vocab terms mean. There are no detailed explanations if user needs them.

#### Beneficial Experiences
* Having a recommendation page as the Home page was nice because it had recipes that the company Tasty recommends to each user.
* Since this company is partnering with Walmart, having a way to shop instantly for items needed for a specific recipe is very beneficial.

#### Additional Questions
* For this usability test, it was nice to be able know what would be nice to include and eliminate for our application. The usability test went well because our application will be very similar to this. Users like to be able to use common sense or immediately see what they need to in order to do what they want. 
* Asked user at certain points how they felt about each action.
* For the next usability test, there should be more complex directions in order to make sure users can give feedback for us to make the process as easy as possible for them. 

#### Statement about Conducting the Test
* It was fairly easy to find an application that is similar to what our application is. Conducting the test was beneficial because we now have more feedback about what to do for our application. Conducting usability tests are a great way to find out what the customer wants and what to add in order to have the best ratings for the application. 

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)

**Show the Purpose**

Having a clear purpose for the website is important. Your website should guide people down the path that the creator of the application wants. If there isn't a clear path that the creator wants to make, there should be an obvious purpose such as giving people a way to enhance their cooking skills in the easiest and most fun way possible.
