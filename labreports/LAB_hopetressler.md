## 2.2 Site 1

Site 1: LinkedIn - I had previously created a LinkedIn account

The home page is easy to navigate. There are different options in the bar at the top of the screen, such as Jobs. You can also clearly see your profile.

![LinkedIn Apply](../assets/LinkedInApply.PNG)
After finding and selecting a job you want to apply for, hit the apply button. This will take you to the company's site and allows you to formally apply for the job. You are able to apply with LinkedIn or do it manually.

|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | I didn't have any difficulties finding what I wanted to find. For example, the job search area. Everything is simple and easy to find. |

It may be confusing to find certain things such as the Adding Skills area in the profile section.  |

## Step 3.5 Findings

#### Improvements 
* Add a way for users to see a rating of each recipe. There are no reviews saying if the recipe is good or not.
* Lessen the amount of filters that show up when user hits the search bar. It can be confusing and overwhelming. 
* Add different ways for users to know what certain vocab terms mean. There are no detailed explanations if user needs them.

#### Beneficial Experiences
* Having a recommendation page as the Home page was nice because it had recipes that the company Tasty recommends to each user.
* Since this company is partnering with Walmart, having a way to shop instantly for items needed for a specific recipe is very beneficial.

#### Additional Questions
* For this usability test, it was nice to be able know what would be nice to include and eliminate for our application. The usability test went well because our application will be very similar to this. Users like to be able to use common sense or immediately see what they need to in order to do what they want. 
* Asked user at certain points how they felt about each action.
* For the next usability test, there should be more complex directions in order to make sure users can give feedback for us to make the process as easy as possible for them. 

#### Statement about Conducting the Test
* It was fairly easy to find an application that is similar to what our application is. Conducting the test was beneficial because we now have more feedback about what to do for our application. Conducting usability tests are a great way to find out what the customer wants and what to add in order to have the best ratings for the application. 

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)

**Show the Purpose**

Having a clear purpose for the website is important. Your website should guide people down the path that the creator of the application wants. If there isn't a clear path that the creator wants to make, there should be an obvious purpose such as giving people a way to enhance their cooking skills in the easiest and most fun way possible.
