# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 15 | Although intuitive and streamlined at first glance, quite a bit of brainpower is needed to use this website. Redundant entry and difficult design accessibility-wise makes for a difficult ride. |
| Indeed | 19 | Pretty strong, although it loses points on an opinonated path and accessibility end. |

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  1  |  The site had a couple confusing areas. For new users, the large amount of new info would be difficult to take in.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2  |  After finishing sign-up, the site did recommend trying for jobs first. However, it asked a lot of favors for improving the user page, most of which was already on my resume.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3  |  If anything, the clarity of each task was obvious. Each command or query was short and to the point.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  3  |  The recommendations were very opinonated, especially when it came to powering up the profile.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2  |  As mentioned before, the clarity is done pretty well. However, it just falls short in the user profile area. The amount of data entry and text bogs down the process by a bit.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3  |  By using standard iconography conventions, the symbols in the navigation bar were all intuitive. Without knowing what the icon was, a new user could likely guess what was behind door number one.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  1  |  There are several points where an attempt was made, although several pitfalls skew the process. For example, the cut-off parts of the user profile would be difficult for screen readers, and requires extra work for mouseless interfaces. On the job finding end, iterating through different opportunities can be difficult. |
| **TOTAL** |  15  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3  |  Signing up was simple, and only required entering a resume. After that, it just shows job listings. Easy enough.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3  |  Yes, especially since it took half, even a third, of the time to set up for other websites. When returning to the site, the first thing seen is the job postings. Very efficient.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3  |  The important steps are all taken care of in sign-up, and special notes are made on each job posting with special warnings and suggestions.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2  |  Although it was obvious it wants you to sign up for jobs, the specificity on the job listings was lacking. It gave everything possible that you are qualified for.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3  |  As of job postings, it only takes the necessary parts rather than showing the opening, and then asking to show more.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3  |  Very effective. The navigation is not the main focus, so it is not used as much, but the common conventions are enough to help that front. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2  |  Although an attempt is clearly made, it falls short when hitting the jobs. Iteration is a little more difficult than most to do such things.  |
| **TOTAL** |  19  |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case
 
| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Personnel Contacts |
| Description / Steps | Internally, navigate to the event page in our app to find people willing to play for your event within the area.  Externally, people can scour social media platforms for people who play instrumentments, find their social media handles, then share their event with them through the app. Navigate to the event’s primary page to share worship events to social media in order to gain more attention or share worship events with specific people on social media to gather more attention. Establish connections between team members through messaging.  This would involve a messaging feature somewhere on the app. Add people to a created worship event. Navigate to the messaging page, which will allow you to message your team members for the event.   
|
| Primary Actor |Individual user engaged with the app |
| Preconditions | <ul><li>Event leader has to download the app</li> <li>Event leader has to create an account</li>  <li>Event leader has to connect social media handles to their account.</li> |
| Postconditions | <ul><li> Invitation to some parties is declined. </li> <li>App is downloaded for other users.</li> <li> An account is made for the other team members. </li>|
 
## Step 3.2 Identify a competitive product
 
### Competitors
Product 1: [Services](https://www.planningcenter.com/services)
<br>Product 2: [VesselWorship](https://www.vesselworship.org/)
 
## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test
 
| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creating an account | <ul><li>Create Username and Password</li> <li>Verify Email</li> </ul>|
| 2 | Creating a team | <ul><li>Adding team members to your team </li><li>Gathering team members info </li> <li>Communicating with them </ul> |
| 3 | Creating a service | <ul><li>Setting a time for the service </li> <li>Setting a date for a service</li> <li>Selecting team members/roles for the service.</li> |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions
 
| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creating an account  | <ul><li>Confusion with confirmation placeholder After selecting your role, it gave an option to add people or services, but this wasn’t intuitive and he didn’t really know what this part wanted him to do so he skipped it. </li><li>On the home page, there was text that made it seem like you were locked in being just a leader, but in reality there are other roles that you can be.</li></ul>|
| 2 | Creating a team | <ul><li>He tried to search for people he wants to add to his team.  When this search was unsuccessful, he realized that you first have to manually create profiles for your team members, then add these to your team.  This was not intuitive from the start </li><li>From the teams page, android’s back button did not function as intended </li><li>Some buttons are off-center when you press the team tab when you’re on the team page. </li><li>He doesn’t know where to find the people that he’s added on the team page. He tried adding a person, but now he can’t find where that person is. </li><li>Design is not intuitive at all, probably requires organizational training for anyone to use it.</li></ul> |
| 3 | Creating a service | <ul><li>When creating a service, he felt confused because he kept clicking the date that he wanted his service be on and then when he tried to create the service, it wouldn’t let him.  He quickly realized that the service time looked like it was set because of the placeholder text’s color but it wasn’t, which is why it wasn’t letting him create his service.</li><li>When this was happening, there wasn’t any feedback about what he was doing wrong, it just highlighted the box red.</li></ul>  |
 
 
## Step 3.5 Findings

### Improvements

Sign-up Clarity: 

<ul><li>Add simple confirmations like “Your email is invalid” or “You left ‘x’ field blank”. </li>

<li>More accurate placeholder text that describes what they want the user to do better. </li></ul>

Beneficial Feedback: 

<ul><li>When creating a service, giving more specific feedback about what the user is doing wrong.</li>

<li>Creating an in-app tutorial for first-time users.</li></ul>

Streamlined Communication

<ul><li>The main form of communication in this app as it stands now is mass emails to every team member.</li>

<li>A solution to this is utilizing instant messaging capabilities like an in-app group chat or channel of some kind.</li></ul>

### Beneficial Experiences

<ul><li>All the team managing features we were looking for were present and this app was the best competitor that we found, which was helpful because it took a while to find an app that was like ours.</li>

<li>There was a dark mode and it overall had a clean aesthetic even though all the functionality wasn’t there.</li></ul>

### Usability Test Reflection

<ul><li>We tried to see ourselves as one of our personas or an average user for the app instead of as a very experienced software user.</li>

<li>We did a good job at breaking down the app into its three main functions, expressing the primary avenues a user will go down.</li>  

<li>Offer a brief statement about your experience conducting a usability test.</li>

<li>Conducting a usability test really opened our eyes into how we will need to develop our app’s ui. Based on what we noticed in our competitor, it will be very important to have a clean design that ensures an intuitive user journey without tremendous roadblocks.</li></ul>
