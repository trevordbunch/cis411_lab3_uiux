- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Clark Associates | 21 | Very simple and easy process, 1 page, took 3 minutes to apply. |
| RSM Consulting | 14 | Lots of information asked, lots of pages, some information was asked for twice, I didn't know how long the process would take.|

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 |  Everything was on one page. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 |  Yes, short application, few questions. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | Everything was clearly laid out.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  3 |  It didn't bring me anywhere, I just filled out the info and they sent me a confirmation email. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 | Everything was straightforward, very little text at all. No repetitions. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | Information boxes and buttons were all clear. I navigated to application from home page --> careers --> direct link for poisition. Very easy to get to.|
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 |  Clear and simple layout. No complex items |
| **TOTAL** | 21  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  2 |  Getting to the application invovled some bouncing around, but once I was on the site it was pretty straightforward. It did feel like it was leading me on a rabbit trail at some points. Multiple instances were I was led to a new window on a sperate tab. Part of this is attributable to the listing for the position being on an external hiring site.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  1 |  They had me upload personal information and resume twice, this made me feel like my time wasn't that valuable to them. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  1 |  They told me what page of the process I was on, but that's it. I was wondering what might be next, if there was anything that might come up after the five steps, and how long it would take. Definitely could have given more information on the process.|
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |  Yes pre-apply site asked what position you were interested in. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2  | I was asked to submit some information twice throughout the process. Could have been better coordinated. Overall not too much wording, so nothing glaringly stands out for this.|
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2 |  Navigation was easy and clear, I made it where I wanted to in the end. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | Things were clearly laid out and information boxes easy to access.  |
| **TOTAL** | 14  |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | View intelligent well stats|
| Description / Steps | Navigate to website. Go to "Well Data". View well stats dashboard|
| Primary Actor | HQ users |
| Preconditions | Wells are equipped with automated reporting kit|
| Postconditions | HQ can view pump usage rates/ average water pumped per day and other useful statistics for fundraising purposes & strategic planning.|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1: [Charity Water](https://www.charitywater.org)
2. Competitor 2: [Life Pump](https://lifepump.org/hundredpump-details/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

* Find Data

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Navigate to charitywater.org |  Charity Water site |
| 2 | Click on  "Our Work" in site navigation bar at the top of the page |   |
| 3 |  Scroll down to area with heading "The Next Step In Sustainability". Click "See our Sensors" link. |   |
| 4 |  Scroll down to area with heading "Actionable Insights" and click "View Dashboard" | This should open a new tab with a map  |
| 5 |  On the map click the circle in Malawi (Southeastern Africa) |   |
| 6 | Click on the circle near Chipata with a label reading "3". | This should bring you closer in on the map to another group of circles which represent well locations.|
| 7 | Click on the furthest one to the left, nearest Chipata. This should open up a small window. There should be a link here where it says data. Click on the link | This will open a dashboard displaying statistics about the well.| 
| 8 | Refresh page is data doesn't load| |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

Friend was: Ethan Barnes. Junior Engineering Student. 

I read the steps to him just how I had them written.  

| Step | Observations |
|---|---|
| 1 |  Quick Google search to find Charity Water site |
| 2 |  Found "Our Work" with ease  |
| 3 |  Found "Our Sensors" link with ease. He naturally began scrolling and looking for the section he wanted to find. |
| 4 |  He found dashboard link with ease, also automatically scrolling and scanning for the section/link he needed.  |
| 5 |  This next step is where he had useability issues. He stated in retrospect “I’m a little geographically challenged”, and “It took me a little while to find Malawi”. |
| 6 |  He found this step easy, and selected the right grouping of wells. |
| 7 |  He found the data with ease and opened the dashboard without issues. |
| 8 |  This step was not necessary  |


## Step 3.5 Findings

#### 3 improvements
1) Finding well data was a really indirect process. Lots of steps and links you had to follow. I think if they had a more paythway that would have made this a lot easier to get to. 

2) It would have been nice to see some live aggregate data for each continent.

3) It would have been nice to have an option to select a well location from a series of drop down lists rather than having to navigate on the map. With the map you have to know the exact location, however, if you are looking for a specific well because it's broken, but don't know the region within the country it could be to find. 

#### 2 benefits
1) I think this offered value to the user becuase they had to work their way through lots of information to get to the data they were tasked with finding. This helped my user gain familiarity with the site and its structure. 
2) I think going through the map was useful becuase it shows the user where in the world the charity has existing well installations. 

#### What do you believe your team did well in conducting the usability test?
I think this usability test was very relevant and similar in some aspects to what we hope to accomplish with our project, which is displaying data from the wells in a an organized format. I don't know what my teamates did for their tests so I can't speak for the rest of them. 

#### What could your team improve for next time (hint: there will be a next time)?

Next time I will make sure we have multiple tasks for the user, and less guidance, so they have to try to figure things out a little more on their own. 

#### Offer a brief statement (no more than several sentences) about your experience conducting a usability test.

This was a fun process, and my tester (Ethan did a great job). He seemed to know where to find things pretty easily which speaks to a good job done by Charity Water's site designers. Overall, I learned some interesting things about design, specifically that quick access to important functions of a site are extremely important. 

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
If you opt to do extra credit, then include it here.

"Keep important things close to home."

Basically don't make me navigate through 5 pages to get to the information I'm looking for. Now with Charity Water, showing the well data is clearly not a primary function of the site, so it makes sense why it's not as easy to get to. But for our intelligent water project it will be a key function of the site so we need quick and direct navigation to that. Even if the navigation is clear and people know where to look for the information, they don't want to have to make a "long journey" from the homepage to the features they seek. Virtual distance is what I'm thinking about here, and I find this relates to the point about "people are busy".
