I hit the autofill with resume button and it made me create an account.

This is where I had to drop my resume.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 | The website did a good job of guiding me where it wanted me to go by making the buttons orange to stand out form the background. The information was designed nice so it flowed and it was easy to find.   |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2 |  This website had multiple options to make the application process fast by autofilling, however when I added my resume it said that there was an error, so I had to manually add my information anyways. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | This website did a good job at highlighted what needed to be done. It had a orange asterisk after each required field, and if you forgot some information, it searched the entire page and put you in the exact spot where you missed.   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | This website did a decent job at telling me what to do. When asked to start the application, all the buttons where in orange except for appliying with LinkedIn, so it was trying to steer you towards the other options.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | The website got down to business where for each headhing it was a few words max, and if there was a description it was a smaller font.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | Navigation of the site was easy due to the bright orange buttons telling you where to click. The navigation bar at the top of screen telling you where you are at in the application process helped gear how much time you have left.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | This is a fairly good website accessibility wise. For the colorblind there are only two colors being used so still be fairly easy to tell where the website wants you to click  |
| **TOTAL** | 2.6  | Overall I think this website does a great job of not making the users think too much due to the color, design layout, and consistency.   |
