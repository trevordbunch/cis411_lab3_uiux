# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Crowdstrike | 2.6 | Crowdstrike's approach of using two colors really sold where it wanted you to click during the entire process and it was bold enough that it caught your eye in every screen. The design was nice in that the navigation bar was always at the top and told you what sections you have completed, need to complete, and how many left you need to do. This website also did not waste my time for the most part except the error of reading my resume.  |
| FedEx | 1.9 | FedEx's website was disappointing. They also used two colors, so it showed you where it wanted you go. The design was also easy on the eyes. However where this website really lacked was the overload of information it through at you and what you needed to complete. The naviagtion bar did not tell you how much you needed to complete and only showd a percentage of the entire process.  |

What the job looks like when you first get to the website.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux2.png)  
This is what the website shows when you hit apply, the autofill with resume was orange to start with.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux3.png)  
I hit the autofill with resume button and it made me create an account.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux4.png)  
This is where I had to drop my resume.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux5.png)   
This is where I add my personal information, the alert said it couldnt fully grab my data from my resume.    
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux6.png)  
This is where it asked my to put in my experiences.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux7.png)  
This is where it asked my questions about why I wanted to work at the company.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux8.png)  
This is where it asked me to accept the terms and condionts.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\uiux9.png) 
And it finally showed my a review of the information I put it in and asked me to submit it.   https://crowdstrike.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/crowdstrikecareers/job/Data-Science-and-Data-Engineering-Internship---Summer-2023--Remote-_R12052?workerSubType=f79adfd173da01f3129fd137e373b210
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 | The website did a good job of guiding me where it wanted me to go by making the buttons orange to stand out form the background. The information was designed nice so it flowed and it was easy to find.   |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2 |  This website had multiple options to make the application process fast by autofilling, however when I added my resume it said that there was an error, so I had to manually add my information anyways. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | This website did a good job at highlighted what needed to be done. It had a orange asterisk after each required field, and if you forgot some information, it searched the entire page and put you in the exact spot where you missed.   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | This website did a decent job at telling me what to do. When asked to start the application, all the buttons where in orange except for appliying with LinkedIn, so it was trying to steer you towards the other options.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | The website got down to business where for each headhing it was a few words max, and if there was a description it was a smaller font.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | Navigation of the site was easy due to the bright orange buttons telling you where to click. The navigation bar at the top of screen telling you where you are at in the application process helped gear how much time you have left.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | This is a fairly good website accessibility wise. For the colorblind there are only two colors being used so still be fairly easy to tell where the website wants you to click  |
| **TOTAL** | 2.6  | Overall I think this website does a great job of not making the users think too much due to the color, design layout, and consistency.   |

## 2.3 [FedEx](https://careers.fedex.com/fedex/jobs?stretchUnits=MILES&stretch=10&location=Lewisberry&lat=40.13509&lng=-76.85969&woe=7)

![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex1.png)  
This shows the job summary and apply button.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex2.png)  
This is where you register your account.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex3.png)  
These are security questions that you have to do in order to register.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex4.png)  
This makes sure that you are applying for the correct posistion and pay.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex5.png)
This was a weird part of the application process that was a waste of my time.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex6.png)  
This showed that FedEx is an equal oppurtunity employer.   
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex7.png)  
This had you fill out the minimum requirements, which I think should be at the start.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex8.png) 
This had you fill out you basic information.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex9.png)  
This had you fill out past jobs.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex10.png)  
This asked if there was any accomadations necessary.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex11.png)  
This asked you your gener and race. These were not optional however you could choose not to share.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex12.png)  
This asked if you were a veteran. When you clicked on an option, that option appeared over the above text and distorted it.  
![image](files://C:\Users\wadeb\Desktop\fedex13.png)  
This asked for if you have a disability. I could have added more screenshots of the process but did not want to overload. This could be too much already.  

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | This website pretty much did not require much thinking, as it showed you the options. It used simple colors and was easy to manuever.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1  | This site did not value my time as it had too many part to the application process which did not need to be there or were in the wrong spots that would have been better towards the start. For example, the minimal requirements were in the middle, but it should have been at the start so you knew that you could even do the job before going through the other parts.   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | The website used the color purple to make the buttons it wanted you to click, however it did not show what parts were optional or required until after you submitted.   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | This website did a good job at guiding you exactly where it wanted you to.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | This website did not omit words. In fact it added uneccessary parts which wasted my time.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | Navigation was not a problem, it was designed pretty nice. However I every much preferred the navigation bar as the other website because this did not show how many more screens you had to go through just your overall progress.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | This website seems to be alright for colorblind people beacuse there are once again only two colors being used.   |
| **TOTAL** | 1.9  | Overall I was not a fan of this website due to the amount of wasted time, and not knowing how many steps I have left. However this website was good with the aestetics, and presented itself nice.   |
