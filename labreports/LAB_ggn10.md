# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn.com | 20 | Overall, LinkedIn is very clean website. It offers straightforward access to all critical points it offers. Profile creation was in-depth and easy. The profile creation assistant was pivotal to the creation process. The job search process was simple and all-inclusive. |
| Indeed.com | 20 | Overall, Indeed is very concise and practical job search website. In comparison to LinkedIn, Indeed is much more focused on job search compared to creating and promoting your profile/network. I feel like it falters a little bit in that area especially when also analyzing LinkedIn. |

## 2.2 Site 1: LinkedIn

Home page has all access points to the critical parts of the website.

![LinkedIn Profile](/ggn10Assets/LinkedInProfileSS.PNG)
Profile was very easy to create and offered great recommendations to improve my profile.

![LinkedIn Job](/ggn10Assets/LinkedInJobSS.PNG)
Job description was very in-depth and I really liked how they had a list of all job offerings in the view.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Creating a profile and searching for a job was easily done and greatly assisted |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Gets right to the point; Everything I needed was right there when I first accessed LinkedIn |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | Important steps/info was made very clear through highlights and large bold boxes |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | Only critique I would have here is that there was so much information it was almost hard to process |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Small and accurate descriptions were always given |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | Each part of the profile creation and job search built upon itself perfectly |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | Linked offers a great mobile app that is very easily accessible |
| **TOTAL** | 20 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2: Indeed

![Indeed Home](/ggn10Assets/IndeedHomeSS.PNG)
Home page was direct and the first thing you see was a job search box.

![Indeed Profile](/ggn10Assets/IndeedProfileSS.PNG)
Profile was a bit scarce compared to LinkedIn

![Indeed Job](/ggn10Assets/IndeedJobSS.PNG)
Job feed was very useful and I like the short and concise "What" and "Where" search criteria's.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Very Intuitive and easy to traverse |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Did not waste any time getting into job searching; The first page was a job search |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | Slightly confusing on how to create profile but other than that very clear |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | Strong emphasis on instant job search feature |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Concise descriptions were everywhere |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | Navigation of the site was very easy and straight forward |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | Very spread out and easy to click on things |
| **TOTAL** | 20 |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case | |
|---|---|
| Title | Add Subscription Service |
| Description / Steps | User must verify their credentials on YourTV as well as the desired subscription service. |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | User has an account and is currently logged in |
| Postconditions | The subscription service is added and accessible to user preferences |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

Competitor: [Truebill](www.truebill/feature/manage-subscriptions.com)  

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creating Account/Logging In | Create a truebill account or login with an existing one. |
| 2 | View Recurring Subscription Costs | Navigate to the recurring tab of the dashboard |
| 3 | View Spending Costs | Navigate to the spendings tab of the dashboard |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Creating Account/Logging In | Creating an account was very simple and straightforward. Truebill has an option where you can set up a free account without having premium. |
| 2 | View Recurring Subscription Costs | Found the recurring tab easily on the dashboard on the left side. They viewed both the 'View All' and the 'Upcoming' tabs. |
| 3 | View Spending Costs    | Found the spending tab like above. They viewed their monthly breakdown for March as well as their summaries for the previous 5 months.  |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Pros:
  - Very simple and straight-forward account creation
  - User-friendly home page that offers everything a user would need to access
  - The recurring tab is very conclusive and allows the user to make decisions on their subscriptions based on the data.
  - The spending tab offers a in-depth breakdown of all spending and income for each month.

Cons:
  - I wish they would explained the difference between premium and free when creating an account
  - Dashboard graph should be made more recognizable, conclusive, and modifiable 

Overall:
  - TrueBill is very user-friendly and easy to use
  - Offers many extremely useful breakdowns that allow users to limit their spending and monitor subscriptions.
  - Conducting a usability test offers a user perspective that is only attainable by running a usability test.
