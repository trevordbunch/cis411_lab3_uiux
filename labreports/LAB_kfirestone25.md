# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| CareerBuilder https://www.careerbuilder.com/ | 16 | I picked CareerBuilder because I believed it was a job site that I believed I would enjoy. For the most part, that was ture. Overall, I think this site is useful for the purpose in which it was intended. It has a sleek, modern design that is appealing to the eye and catches your attention. CareerBuilder is to the point, easy to use (for the most part), and time efficient. The way in which the application automtically populates your profile using your resume and the "One-Click Easy Apply" are standout features. However, the actual job search function is tedious and not a personable experience. Despite this downfall, CareerBuilder received a relatively high score. When it comes to tracking one's experience through measurable outcomes in the profile section, CareerBuilder is most helpful rather than Indeed. |
| Indeed https://www.indeed.com/ | 17 | It is quite surprising that the site I did not think I would enjoy received a higher score than the site I believed I would. When it comes to user-friendliness and usability, Indeed is just easy to use. Not only does it make signing up for an account easy by using your previous Google, Facebook, and Apple accounts and your uploaded resume, but it also simplifies the job search. You can easily search for jobs by their title, keyword, company or location. After completing five simple steps, your application is sent to your desired company. However, the profile section is quite plain. With no true measurable outcomes within the site and no notifications, it is quite hard to track your job searching experience. When it comes to the act of job searching, Indeed is definitely victorious over CareerBuilder. |

## 2.2 Site 1

CareerBuilder - https://www.careerbuilder.com/  
(Job site I believe I would like)

![Creating Account](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=918&h=447)

* To create my account, the site needed minimal information from me. By uploading by resume, the website was able to automatically fill out my work history and educational background. 

![Career Goals](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=918&h=420)

* After creating my account, I was given the option to provide some career goals including desired job title, location, salary, etc. By doing so, the site would ideally be able to better tailor my job search to better fit me. Since I did not have a particular number in mind when it came to desired salary, the site allowed me to leave it blank, which was very helpful. 

![My Profile](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=660&h=323)

* The site provides a dashboard that contains useful and helpful information such as recommended jobs, profile views, number of applied jobs, etc. 

![Searching for Jobs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=855&h=417)

* Searching for a job was surprisingly complicated. Instead of providing a search bar, the site instead opens to this overwhelming screen with hundreds of links.

* Since I entered my desired location in the "Career Goals" section of the sign-up process, I thought that the site was going to tailor the job search experience for me. However, it provided me with Data Analyst job opportunities all over the United States. Beyond that, I could not find a button that would allow me to sort or filter the jobs by location. 

![Applying for Jobs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=847&h=324)

* Although searching for the jobs was more complicated than it needed to be, the site does offer a "One-Click Easy Apply." This basically means that the site is able to automatically put in an application for you if you have previously uploaded your resume. This is a huge time-saver and excellent feature. 

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | As far as ease-of-use, the site was very good. It is relatively easy to understand besides navigating the job search page. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | Creating an account was super quick and easy, along with the application process (One-Click Easy Apply). However, the actual act of searching for a job took a significant amount of time. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | When it came to instructions, I was able to understand how to use the site. During the "Career Goals" portion of the sign-up process, I was allowed to leave sections that were unknown to me at the moment, such as "desired salary" blank, which was very helpful. Although, I do believe the way in which they have set up the act of job searching could have been simplified and more user-friendly. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | It was clear that the site wanted the user to obtain a job. When signing up, you can select that you would like to receive notifications when potential jobs arose or employers show interest in you. Also, they have the dashboard in your profile that provides helpful information. It is clear that the site is working to be of upmost help in the job search process. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Everything on the site is well-labeled, but it is not overwhelming users with buttons or extra words. It is very clear what the purpose of the site is by the buttons/labels/instructions that are provided. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | The process of creating an account flowed very nicely and I had no issues. Although I believe there was a more efficient way to organize the "job search" page, it flowed very nicely and was easy to navigate once you got used to it. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | Considering the way in which the "job search" page is laid out, I have reason to believe that those accessing the site via a screen reader or mouse-less interface will have a bit of difficultly navigating and viewing the website compared to a desktop user. |
| **TOTAL** | 16 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

Indeed - https://www.indeed.com/  
(Job site I believe I will not prefer)

![Creating Account](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=631&h=299)

* Signing in/creating an account is very easy with the Indeed site. I was able to use my google account to sign up, meaning that I was done with the sign-up process in under a minute. 

![Profile](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=658&h=299)

* The site offers the option to upload your resume. By doing so, the site promises that it will automatically fill out your information. 

![Searching for Jobs](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXh3lXPP4oiAuiStb49TWE0R_MkgJ4Vub7HGUph-gX4fTL0Mhh6p0zX7ItPDJoSKIO7QUDORBiucsb/pub?w=628&h=297)

* Indeed makes searching for a job very easy. When I clicked on the "Find Jobs" button, it took me to a page where there was a two search bars and a job feed. You could easily search for jobs by the title, keywords, or the company and give an exact location in which you are looking. Mechanicsburg, PA was already entered into the "where" box, making the experience customizable to me.

* The application process is relatively simple if you have previously uploaded your resume. It inclues only five steps. Although, in comparison to CareerBuilder, it includes much more manual entering of information.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | The site was easy to understand. I did not find myself confused while using the site, except when it came to trying to navigate my profile and the features that were provided. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Creating my account was super easy as you could use your previous accounts on Google, Apple or Facebook to log in. The act of searching for a job was also made simple because there was a search bar for both the job title and location. Lastly, you could apply for a job in just five simple steps. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | Throughout the sign-up process and the application process, the steps were laid out nicely for me to follow. However, I did not like that each blank throughout the process had to be filled out. If I do not know my desired salary or do not want to mention it, I think the site should allow me to leave it blank. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1 | It is very clear that the site is for finding a job. However, I believe it would have been helpful to have measurable outcomes on the site including but not limited to the number of individuals who have viewed your profile, the jobs you've applied to, etc. I believe these measures, along with email or text notifications, keep you on track in your job search. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | There was just enough instructions to know how to use the site, but it would not overwhelm the user with too many words. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | It was very easy to navigate the site, through the sign-up process and the job search process. I truly believe indivduals with little to no experience in technology could easily understand the workflow of this site. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | Since the site offers a mostly-seemless web experience, it would be reasonable to conclude that the site would be accessible to those using screen readers or mouse-less interfaces. |
| **TOTAL** | 17 |   |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Finding a Location |
| Description / Steps | 1. User logs into account. 2. User will navigate to community map (if not already there). 3. User will click "search/filter" button and provide necessary criteria. 4. Users will click on location(s) based on the output of the search. 5. Users will choose their desired location. |
| Primary Actor | Hiker |
| Preconditions |1. User must have account. 2. Application has locations available and ready. 3. Connection to Internet is established.|
| Postconditions | 1. After desired location is picked, the application should provide relevant information surrounding the location. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1: All Trails https://www.alltrails.com/  
   (Utilized for the Useability Test)
2. Competitor 2: Gaia GPS https://www.gaiagps.com/

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Search for a trail by your city | Navigate to the main screen and input your city into the search bar. |
| 2 | Log into your account | From the main screen, click the "Log In" button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.|
| 3 | Navigate to the AllTrails shop | From the main screen, hover over the drop-down list in the top left-hand corner of the screen and click on "AllTrails Gear."  |
| 4 | Filter Trails by "Easy" | Navigate to the Explorer Page via the button in the top left-hand corner. Find the "Difficulty" dropdown filter and select "Easy" |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions


| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Search for a trail by your city | The participant was successful in entering her city of Brookhaven, PA via the search bar on the main page and finding hikes that are nearby. There was no sign of struggle or frustration through this task. |
| 2 | Log into your account | The participant was successful in finding the "Log In" button in the top right-hand corner of the screen. There was no sign of confusion when it came to this simple task. |
| 3 | Navigate to the AllTrails shop | The participant was successful in navigating to the "AllTrails Gear" via the "Shop" drop-down menu at the top. This was a simple task for the participant. |
| 4 | Filter Trails by "Easy" | When I gave the participant the task of filtering trails by "Easy," there was a bit of confusion. Since you first had to find the "Explore" page before finding the option, it took a bit of time and hints for the participant to complete this task. |

## Step 3.5 Findings

Improvements

* The ability to filter hikes from the homescreen would be of benefit to the user. It would not only be a time saver, but omit any confusion.
* Since many people have pets, it would be helpful to know that information when you first pull up the potential hike.
* A list of potential wildlife that you could see on the hike would be a good feature. People might be interested in seeing a specific type of animal or worried that they might encounter a dangerous animal. It would be a good heads-up for users.

Experiences that were of benefit to the user

* The search bar is the feature that catches your eye as soon as you access the AllTrails website or application. It not only highlights the purpose of the website, but also is a timesaver for users. 
* On the main screen, the site provides a section titled "Local Favorites in Mechanicsburg." Of course, the AllTrails site uses your current location to provide you with recommended hikes. This creates a personalized experience for the user and welcomes those who may not be as familar with trails in the area.

What did the team do well in conducting the useability test?

* When conducting the useability test, I believe that individuals on the team did a good job of observing the participant. We each had a different participant that we conducted our useability test on, and each participant provided us with more and more information about the useability of the AllTrails application. I made sure to observe the body language of the participant, checking for signs of frustration or confusion, and only provided hints when it was absolutely necessary for the participant to complete the task. 

What could the team improve for next time?

* I think that, as a team, we could be more complex in the tasks that we give the participants in the useability test. Although, we must be sure to remain clear and concise with our instructions. Since task four was not explained well, the participant was confused as to where to access the "Difficulty" filter. 

My experience conducting a useability test:

* I had a very good experience conducting my first useability test. It is quite interesting to me to observe someone's body language when navigating through an application and attempting to complete a task. I feel that conducting useability tests gives app developers so much insight into the ways in which there application can be improved. Although this was a simple and rookie useability test, it laid a solid foundation of my knowledge of this topic and helped me see areas in which I could improve.
