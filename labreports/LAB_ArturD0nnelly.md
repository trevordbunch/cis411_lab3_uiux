# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| indeed.com | 21 | indeed.com is a clean-looking website with an easy sign-up process and many futures. When signing up, it provides you a visual understanding of how long it will take to sign in, by showing you the tabs that would need to be complete. No problems with signing up and by uploading the resume it will feel in some blanks using the information from the resume. Searching for the jobs is couple step process and the results are most relevant with all information that is needed, like salary, location, ratings, and description. The website is also really clean without extra working or unneeded information. |
| simplyhired.com | 16 | simplyhired.com is a well-designed website that takes only a couple of minutes to sign up. In the beginning, there is unnecessary information on the bottom. It shows the jobs around you. Without knowing what the person is looking for, this information is not relevant and not needed. When searching for the job it provides all information that is needed, like salary, location, ratings, and description. The website is clean-looking, has no unnecessary information, and provides the most useful tabs. Unfortunately, the navigation process is not perfect and can be improved. |

## 2.2 Site 1

1. 
![Preferences](../assets/indeed_job_search.png)
Something that I really liked about indeed is that it allowed a lot of options of how to search for the job. So, the user would have a better experience looking for the job that is wanted.
 
2. 
![Resume](../assets/indeed_resume.png)
One future that I have found interesting and I think really useful is that indeed could create a resume for you. The resume is created from the information that is entered during the sign-up.

3. 
![Reviews](../assets/indeed_review.png)
I have found the companies reviews really helpful. I really like that indeed has a tab where the user can look up the reviews on different companies. This future can be really helpful if the user doesn't have the company in mind.

4. 
![Sign-Up](../assets/indeed_sign-up.png)
When I was signing up, I really liked that it had a scale on the top that says what you need to complete to finish. This is really helpful if the person is really inpatient or doesn't have much time.

5. 
![Error](../assets/indeed_skills.png)
There was one thing that I found to be really annoying. When I was entering the skills I clicked enter without having the skill entered, and after that, it would not let me move on to the next step without reloading the page. There is nothing much that I would do besides fixing this error.

6. 
![Spelling](../assets/indeed_speling.png)
One little thing that I thought was really interesting, is that indeed has its own spelling check. This is really helpful since many can make simple mistakes when feeling out the profile and the spelling errors would make the user look bad.

7.
![Accessibility](../assets/indeed_accessibility.png)
I think that everyone deserves to be treated well. So, I really like that indeed is dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience to every user.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 | Indeed is a well intuitive website that provides a lot of choices and functions. Everything on the website is accessible and there is no problem with figuring out how things work. everything is clear and easy to understand. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 | This website does value the time of the user. The sign-up process is quick and easy. Even if the user is not signed up user can still search for the job positions without spending time on the sign-up process.   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | Indeed did a great job presenting only the information that is needed. When clicking the search button, it shows only information that is needed for the job search. When the result list is up, only needed information about the position is provided.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |  Indeed is great with leading the person through the steps. When signing-up indeed leads you through the sign-up steps. Also, indeed leads you through the steps when applying for the job. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  |  Indeed used as few words as possible while still covering all important information that the user needs to know. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow/navigation of the site? | 3  | Indeed has a menu bar on top of the site that is really useful to navigate yourself from job search to your profile, from your profile to salaries tab. Also, when applying for the job, it is easy to go back to make changes to the application.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 |  Indeed is great for supporting those with accessibility needs. The website has a page that is dedicated to accessibility at indeed. On that page, the user can find everything that is needed to know if there are any accessibility challenges. Also, indeed highly encouraging the users to give feedback if there is something in the accessibility area that they should work on. |
| **TOTAL** |  21 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2

1. 
![Encryption](../assets/SimplyHired%20email%20encription.png)
Something that I have found to be really cool and helpful is the fact that simplyhired changed my email visually, so no one who is not intended to see it would have access to it. 

2. 
![Resume_Builder](../assets/SimplyHired%20resume_builder.png)
simplyhired has the resume builder that helps the user to build the resume. I really like that this website helps the user to build a resume, so they can successfully get the job.

3. 
![Accessibility](../assets/SimplyHired_accessibility.png)
simplyhired is really helpful to find the job you are looking for, but I'm really disappointed that it doesn't show great accessibility. If I could do something about I would implement screen readers, also build a support group that would be able to help the user that has special needs.

4. 
![Navigation](../assets/SimplyHired.png)
A lot of things on the website were hidden on the top right corner tab. I would take some things like company pages and saved jobs to the top for better access.

5. 
![email](../assets/SimplyHired_no%20email.png)
I have found that it did not let me connect my email. If I would like to get notifications on the email about potential jobs opening, it could be problematic. I would definitely allow the email to be connected. Without the email, the user wouldn't be able to get notified about job openings or notifications from simplyhired.

6. 
![Sign-Up](../assets/SimplyHired_sign-up.png)
When I was trying to sign up I have found that there was a problem with signing up using a google account. So, all that was left is using the Facebook account. This is really problematic, especially if the user doesn't have a Facebook account. I would probably add more sign-up options like using emails, phone numbers, username and password, and many others. 

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  |  simplyhired.com is a well intuitive website and there should be no problem finding things, or figuring out how something works. One thing that could be improved is to take some tabs out from the top right corner unrolling tab and place some of them on top for easier access. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 |  simplyhired has a really fast sign-up process. Also, users are still able to search for jobs even without signing-up. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | simplyhired.com is a really clean website where there is not much extra information or details at all. When searching for jobs, only important information about the position is presented.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2 |  simplyhired.com does a really good job with the sign-up process, where it takes just a couple of steps for a job search. When searching for the job it tells you what to enter where and so on. One thing that simplyhired could have done better is take the user through the steps to set up the profile for comfortable use. After the user has sign-up, they are on their own. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | simplyhired.com does not use many words while still explaining everything that they need to. Most words it uses on one page are all the way on the bottom where it includes sections like contact us, social media, and so on.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow/navigation of the site? |  3 | The navigation on the website felt pretty good. The website has a menu bar that is always on the top, and if the user is stuck, there is always a way back.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0  | The website doesn't look to be working with people that have accessibility issues.   |
| **TOTAL** |  16 |   |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/)
2. Competitor 2 [World Vision](https://www.worldvision.org/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test


### Charity: Water
| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Find the fundraising page |  The user should open the fundraising page through the involvement tab |
| 2 |  Sign up | The user needs to sign up in order to create a fundraiser campaign  |
| 3 |  Create the campaign |  The user needs to come up with the name and amount of money that they wish to come up with |
| 4 | Make the first donation to created campaign |  To make a donation user has to enter the bank card information or use PayPal |
| 5 |  Invite more people into the campaign | To invite more people to the campaign user is provided with the options to use Facebook, Twitter. User also can use their own options of spreading the word about this campaign  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

### Charity: Water
| Step | Tasks | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Find the fundraising page |  After making a visual observation of the page participant have chosen to click on the "Get Involved Tab". From there participant chose to click on the Fundraiser tab. Participant comment that it was fairly easy to find.|
| 2 |  Sign up | After I told the participant to sign up, he quickly clicked the sign-in tab. After asking him why he did that, he said: "I clicked sign-in knowing that if I don't have an account, it will give me the option to sign-up". The participant was pleased to know that his predicament was right. After entering email, name, and password, the participant was instantly signed up. The participant said that he expected it to have more options of how the user could sign-up. |
| 3 |  Create the campaign |  After I told the participant to create the campaign, it took a couple of seconds to remember that he had sawed the button to create the campaign on the fundraiser page. The participant said that it probably would have taken him longer to find where to create the campaign if he wouldn't have visited the fundraiser page before. After finding where to create the campaign all that participant had to do is enter the name for the campaign and the amount of money he would like to raise. The participant was pleasantly surprised by how little is required to create the campaign. He said: "I thought it would take a lot more steps than that, and that I would need to provide a lot more information. |
| 4 | Make the first donation to created campaign |  To make the first donation into an earlier created campaign the participant has first clicked on the donate button. Where he has found that donations to his campaign can not be made from there. After that participant navigated to the "Get Involved tab" wherefrom he navigated to "Support a Campaign". After that, he has searched the name of the early created campaign, which was "Need water for summer", and have found one that he has created. To donate he entered the amount and his name, wherefrom he proceeded to entering banking information or choosing PayPal. The participant has said that he was somewhat frustrated that he had to look hard for the campaign that he has created. Also, he said that the donation process was really simple and easy and that after knowing where the campaign is stored it is no problem to get to it. |
| 5 |  Invite more people into the campaign | After I told the participant to invite more people into the campaign, he asked me a question: "Do Charity Water provides any ways to inform people about the campaign, or do I need to copy the URL and post it on the social media?". I told him that there are some methods they provide to spread the word about the campaign. After getting my answer, the participant navigated to the early created campaign, where he had found two social media tabs that were located beside the edit campaign button. After clicking on it he almost immediately figured out that it was for telling people about the campaign. The participant said: "It was not too hard to find the two tabs that were created for campaign advertisement, because Artur has told me that something that I'm looking for is there. But, I feel like some people probably wouldn't know what those buttons are for, and would use copied URL as the way of advertisement". The participant was also disappointed with so few options of campaign advertisement. |

## Step 3.5 Findings

 I thinking having the search bar that would be used to search for specific things would improve usability. So, instead of looking for things all over the place, the user can just search for a keyword. Also, having more sign-up options could be highly beneficial. This will give users freedom of how they would like to be connected to the website. Another thing that I think would be helpful is to improve communication between the users. Campaign creators should be able to communicate with each other, which will be highly beneficial in the long run. Having the way to communicate on the website would encourage collaboration. 

Two experiences in the workflow that I think was of benefit to the user are how fast the user can get involved, and how quick is the sign-up process. It is without a dought that this website values users' time. So, if the user just wants to get in, get involved in something that makes a difference. It can be done in a matter of a couple of minutes.

In the usability that we have conducted, we were testing what would be users' experience trying to get involved and give financial support. In the application that we would be building donations would be a really important aspect. So, I think that we did well by making the participant going through the steps of getting involved.

For the next time, I think it would be important to conduct usability tests from a different OS like android, iOS, Linux, and so on. Also, maybe taking more people for the test would be helpful too. So, if all of the participants would be stuck in the same spot, or if most of the participants would like the same thing on the website, then we would have more accurate data.

Conducting a usability test was interesting and I think it is highly helpful. Conducting this kind of test would help to identify what is something that users like about the website, something that they found helpful, something that they hate, or maybe something that made them frustrated. All of this information could be used for the future development of our application. So, whatever many users didn't like we'll make sure to stay away from it if possible, and whatever users found good would be implemented. 

## 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)

### Give me the Freedom
All people are different from each other, and everyone likes to do things differently. The user should be provided with more than three options of how to do things. For example, to sign-up, the user should be able to use personal email, Facebook, phone number, creating a user name and password, and so on. Users should not be limited to only one or two options.
