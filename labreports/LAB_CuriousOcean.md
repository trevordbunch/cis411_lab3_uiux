# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites


## 2.1 LinkedIn Summary Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 21 | A+. Very friendly, clear, and did not make me think too much or waste my time.  |
| Indeed | 11.5 | F. Almost the exact opposite of what LinkedIn was like. Wasted my time and hurt my eyes to look at.  |

## 2.2 LinkedIn

![lab3proof](../lab3proof/Linkedin1.png)
Step 1: Since I already had a LinkedIn profile, I displayed the ease of accessibility to find my profile. As one can see, in the top right there is a drop-down menu that gives me multiple options for my accounts, such as "View Profile", "Settings and Privacy", "Help" and much more.

Step 2: Here I am able to add/remove/change any skills that I have learned during my career. I also have the ability to add certifications, and reviews from co-workers. 

![lab3proof](../lab3proof/LinkedInProof3.PNG)
Step 3: Here I was able to type into the search bar on the top and search for a job. I had a multitude of options within my search, such as location, experience level, job type, company, date the job was posted, and even if the job was on site or remote. 

LinkedIn has a unique feature where you can apply with your LinkedIn account, which includes your resume. This is one of its best features, as it cut back on time that would be wasted filling in information already on your resume.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | It was very intuitive. Everything felt natural and enjoyable.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | It very much did. I felt like LinkedIn was clear and concise about every feature and what they did. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | It did. Like I said earlier, they were very clear with what everything did and how it could help me.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | Kinda. It jobs specific to my query, but also offered similar jobs.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | Very careful.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | I was able to navigate with ease. Even if I could get lost, I would be able to read and figure out where I was.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 | It was very accessible to both screen reader and mouse-less interface.  |
| **TOTAL** | 21  | A+  |

## 2.3 Indeed
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.
![lab3proof](../lab3proof/IndeedProof1.PNG)
Step 1: Right off the back, the website blasts me with so much white space. The icons are all in a soft grey, struggling to stand out and become noticable. It offers me a position to create a profile and add it, and get help for my resume and saved jobs or demographics.

![lab3proof](../lab3proof/IndeedProof2.PNG)
Step 2: Again, quite an ugly page. I'm blasted with white space, hurting my eyes. I have the ability to edit my profile and upload resume, or build a unique Indeed Resume... which eats away at my time. 

![lab3proof](../lab3proof/IndeedProof3.PNG)
Step 3: Once again, Indeed loves the brightness of their website. I think in total the only bright thing is the sunflower by their logo on the first picture. Here I was able to find several jobs for my search query of "cyber security". I had the option of deciding my location. Interestingly enough, Indeed does not have their own unique application system. They merely point me in the right direction for the role of "Director of Cybersecurity Education", offering a link to Messiah's website. 


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | It was clear and concise.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  1 | No it did not. It wanted me to make a unique Indeed resume.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |  The website was boring and bland. It had extra options for stuff like demographics and reviews, but they do not seem important to me. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1.5 | Yes, it provided me with a position. But it did not offer filtering by experience.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  1 | Not at all   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  1 |  It was terrible. It wastes my time and hurts my eyes. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 |  For all its faults, this is the one thing that Indeed is successful at. |
| **TOTAL** | 11.5  | F  |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Finding a Recipe |
| Description / Steps | The user is hungry and bold, deciding to try something new. They log into their account and search in the query "Grilled Reuben Sandwich". RecipeForSuccess will display a recipe with its skill level(If the skill level is higher than the users, it will warn the user). The user will follow the directions and steps and have the option of leaving a review, sharing the recipe, and taking a photo of their final product. |
| Primary Actor | User who is hungry and wants to try a new recipe. |
| Preconditions | User has an account and ingredients for desired recipe. |
| Postconditions | User is able to create the recipe. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [www.bbcgoodfood.com](www.bbcgoodfood.com)
2. Competitor 2 [www.paprikaapp.com](www.paprikaapp.com)
3. Competitor 3 [tasty.co](tasty.co)

## Step 3.3 Useability Test: Accessing the ease and flow of navigating a recipie/cookbook moblie app

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Access app  | Access it  |
| 2 |  Understand icons, navigation |  Have user try to understand icons and what they are supposed to do |
| 3 | Explore User profile settings  | Edit profile and explore all options  |
| 4 | Search for recipe, read intrustions and comment on clarity/confusion  | Ask user  |
| 5 |  Interview test subject  |  Ask what they liked, didn't like, and what they saw as helpful. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Access app  | Access it  |
| 2 |  Understand icons, navigation |  Have user try to understand icons and what they are supposed to do |
| 3 | Explore User profile settings  | Edit profile and explore all options  |
| 4 | Search for recipe, read intrustions and comment on clarity/confusion  | Ask user  |
| 5 |  Interview test subject  |  Ask what they liked, didn't like, and what they saw as helpful. |

## Step 3.5 Findings on the app Tasty
I interviewed a friend, Anna Brock. I chose her because she is an Art Major and I believe that would allow her to have a unique insight for layout and icon reability. I had Anna go through the app Tasty, a competitor listed above. 

**What Worked** Subject found the list of options for dietary restrictions very helpful. It allows both vegans and normal people to eat and use the app. Subject also enjoyed the insight and helpfulness of videos and pictures. It enchanced the instructions. The search bar was able to be refine the query to the subject's experience. Being able to change the serving size was also something that brought great joy to the subject. 

**What Didn't Work** Subject felt like there was an information overload and they did not like being recommended to buy products as they were reading. The process of adding to a personal cookbook was confusing and subject struggeled to add recipies to the personal cookbook. Subject also did not like that they could not substitute ingredients during the process. 

**Room for Improvement** Subject suggested adding an allergy filter. Tasty asked for vegan options, but they did not offer a specific query for allergies. They also suggested adding an option to search for "Don't show me recipes with" and add an option for non-alcoholic recipes.
