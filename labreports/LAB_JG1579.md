# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [/ ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [/ ] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 21 | Was quick and painless for both actions. A nice and easy website for people job searching |
| ZipRecruiter | 15 | Was looking for too many details through the sign up process. It should have been in another section. The job search was on the other hand very easy. Other than the sign up it was a fairly good site|

## 2.2 Indeed

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [http://biblefolk.com](http://biblefolk.com)
2. Competitor 2 [PrayerMate](https://www.prayermate.net/app)
3. Competitor 3 [https://www.101christiansocialnetwork.com](https://www.101christiansocialnetwork.com)
4. Competitor 4 [https://indiegospel.net/](https://indiegospel.net/)

5. Competitor 5 [https://www.prayerchainonline.net](https://www.prayerchainonline.net)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test
Subject:BibleFolk
| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Find the account creation page  |Will not be creating one   |
| 2 | Find a user  |  There are several ways but not the usual |
| 3 | Find and access a photo  | There is a tab on the left  |
| 4 |  Find a access a video |  Same as above |
| 5 |  Find a top rated blog | Requires more interaction  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |   Find the account creation page|  User quickly found it as they looked to the left of the webpage |
| 2 |  Find a user |  They were confused on what do to for it and clicked widely. Commented on there being no search bar. |
| 3 | Find and access a photo  | User pressed wildly and was unable to see the photo tab. They found it on the blog page and pressed there. It was accomplished in an unorthodox way because the tabs were not clearly visible(faint gray on white)   |
| 4. |  Find and access a video |  User was able to find the video quickly as they had figured out there were more tabs on the side. It lead to a link on a different website and didn't preview the video on the biblefolk website |
| 5 |  Find a top rated blog | User had already found this page earlier and quickly found the top rated button. This was at the top of the screen. They then were uncomfortable with the fact it showed the whole fist page of the blog and found it cultish   |

## Step 3.5 Findings
The website has very clearly old and hadn't been updated in a while.  It is very easy to improve upon it.
1. Change side bars colors to white on red.
2. Add in a search function to finds things more easily.
3. Shorten the Blogs to just their title so that the entires don't take up a lot of room

There isn't much that was easy or of benefit to a modern user.
1. Showed where people who use the site are located
2. The tab was on the left

Our team split up the work so that we could cover more ground on the competitors. This let us get a better idea of what we can do better. Next time we can focus on one website to search more into it. We did a wide look this time next time we should have a more narrow focus.  Overall we worked a bit more individually unless we were testing each others work. We should have done this as more of an organized team. My website was awkward for my sister to go through as it was more of a extremist website. Otherwise it went fine.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
Always look to improve

When you design a website and launch it that should not be the end of your journey. Maybe you didn't obey one of the previous rules or there was a new cultural shift. Either way people are fickle and you should try and adapt the product to the changing times as best you can. If you don't your product may be lost, ridiculed or taken down. The best products are those that are adaptable/flexible.
