# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [/] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [ ] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
|Dice | <center>12</center> | Altogether pretty useful, but there were a few pages that were not clear or repetitive. |
| Glasdoor | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1
**Home page with registration as the first thing I see.**

**Registration has good account creation practices like re-typing password and a captcha**
![Picture2](../labreports/Assets/(dice)2captcha.png)

**Skills tabs do not allow for proof of skills**

**Search page does not have a lot of useful information like salary or user reviews**

**Easy to apply, but information has to be restated**

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Instagram](www.instagram.com)
2. Competitor 2 [Discord](www.discord.com)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| 2 | Fill out the information require to register  | Required information: Email, Username, Password, Date of Birth.  |

|4| Verification|Email verification or Mobile verification|
| 5 | User can show that they are logged in on the application.  |  User is successfully able to log into the app. |

| 2 | Fill out the information require to register  | Could not set their password as "password".  |
| 3 | Follow the account creation process | Captcha and date of birth. Two-factor authentication. The User disliked having to do multiple captchas throughout the creation process.|
| 4 | Verification | Verification by email or phone (email was chosen). |
| 5| User can show that they are logged in on the application  | User succesfully logged in to discord. User was delighted that the process didn't take more than a few minutes and felt very fast. |

## Step 3.5 Findings

**Findings**
<ol><li>User was delighted at the smooth sign up procedure</li><li>
User was mildly frustrated at the multiple captchas required.</li><li>User felt like the whole process was under a minute.</li><li>
Security factor in the form of an email verification was implemented.</li></ol>

**Improvements that could be made.**
<ol><li> Re-typing password and password strength checker should be implemented.</li><li> Required too many captchas during the registration process which the user did not like. Cutting down on them or requiring one at the end of the process would be an improvement.</li><li>The terms and conditions were automatically confirmed and was in very small print. Having a dedicated window for it would be an improvement.</li></ol>

**Beneficial experiences**
<ol><li>Fast and smooth sign-up procedure</li><li>Email verification</li></ol>

**Team Summary**
<ol><li>Created a well defined usability test on a relevant and required feature of the app.</li> <li> Worked together cohesively as a team without any conflicts.</li><li>The team has room to improve on note taking.</li></ol>

**Brief Statement**  
It was an interesting experience seeing someone go through a process that I myself have gone through multiple times and It was easy to see the flow thanks to defining the Useability test



# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
Murphy's Law. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A button that is clearly for registration might be missed by someone or someone might have inputed wrong data. Having multiple buttons to lead to where you want the user to go will help. Also being ready for users to not be unable to follow simple instructions is good practice.
