- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site     | Score | Summary |
|----------|-------|---|
| LinkedIn | 14    | Summary 1 |
| Indeed   | 20    | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1 - LinkedIn
![LinkedIn Profile Page](../assets/Screenshot_1537.png)
I already had an account on LinkedIn, shown above. I do not like the multiple "edit" buttons on this page, I would prefer one to take me to a separate edit page, rather than working with pop-ups for each element.

![LinkedIn Jobs Tab](../assets/Screenshot_1542.png)
The LinkedIn "Jobs" tab gives many options for narrowing searches. I would like more direction on this page; multiple items seem to have the same importance.

![LinkedIn Jobs Search](../assets/Screenshot_1543.png)
After clicking one of the tiles of suggested searches, I am led to the job listings page.

![Third Party Application](../assets/Screenshot_1544.png)
After pressing the "Apply" button, I was taken to the soliciting company's separately hosted job application page.

|---|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3           | The designated tabs work as expected based on their visual design.                                                 |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1           | The social aspect of LinkedIn makes it feel like it is trying to get me to spend more time than necessary with it. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2           | LinkedIn uses color well.                                                                                          |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1           | No; related to it not respecting my time, LinkedIn appears to encouraging endless scrolling and wandering.         |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2           | LinkedIn used more text than its competitor below, though it generally observes the principle.                     |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3           | The navigation is effective in achieving its purposes, though those purposes are not always aligned with mine.     |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2           | I nagiated the website using a mousepad and do not require a screen reader                                         |
| **TOTAL** | 14/21       | I would describe LinkedIn overall as bloated or feature crept.                                                     |

## 2.3 Site 2 - indeed
![indeed New Account](../assets/Screenshot_1538.png)
I had to create an account on indeed for this project. Above is the profile menu after logging in using my Messiah Google account.

![indeed Profile Page](../assets/Screenshot_1539.png)
Uploading my resume took me to the profile page.

![indeed job search](../assets/Screenshot_1540.png)
After clicking the "Jobs" tab and entering basic searh parameters, here is the results page. I do not like that the additional filter elements here are hidden in the initial search menu, before the page depicted here.

![third party job application](../assets/Screenshot_1541.png)
Through the search results, I was taken to the company's (third party's) website to actually apply. LinkedIn does something similar, but I would love to see an inductry standardized apllication form.

|---|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3           | UI was very clean and clear.                                                                     |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3           | I would say that it did value my time, as it did not waste it.                                   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3           | Gave prompt screens when necessary, highlighted expected next actions with color.                |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3           | I don't know if opinionated is the word that I would use, but it was specific, as denoted above. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3           | Words were used only when necessary.                                                             |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3           | Excellently, it used tabs AND had few tabs at that.                                              |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2           | I nagiated the website using a mousepad and do not require a screen reader.                      |
| **TOTAL** | 20/21       | Overall, indeed is one of the easiest and most effective websites I hve ever used.               |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks                                                            | Notes                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Donate to Prayer Chain Online                                    | Under the Donate tab, or under Help, both of which redirect to PayPal |
| 2    | Discover how to submit a prayer request                          | This is one of the first dropdowns under the Help tab                 |
| 3    | Find an estimate of how many prayer requests they have processed | Under the about tab, in blocks of text                                |
| 4    | Discover how to reset your password                              | Log In tab, then select "Forgot your password?"                       |
| 5   | Find the different methods of contacting the organization        | No phone number listed, only email  under Contact tab                 |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations                                                                                                    |
|------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Donate to Prayer Chain Online  | Tester was able to find the donate page, but found it somewhat off putting that it did not prompt an amount.    |
| 2    | Discover how to submit a prayer request  | Tester was blocked from actually submitting a prayer request without logging in, but was able to find the menu. |
| 3    | Find an estimate of how many prayer requests they have processed  | Tester did not find this information to be intuitively placed, and felt he had to read too much to find it.     |
| 4    | Discover how to reset your password  | Tester was able to find this easily, as it was located where other websites normally locate it.                 |
| 5   | Find the different methods of contacting the organization  | No phone number listed, only email  under Contact tab. Tester found this odd                                    |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Website areas to improve:
1. Almost no interactive elements
2. Does not promote user confidence in security or functionality
3. Has too much text 
Website positives:
1. Has a straightforward structure
2. No bugs (overlapping HTML elements, loading screens, etc.)
3. Is approachable, which aligns with site goals (community, faith, etc.)

Team areas to improve:
1. Begin work sooner
2. Upon doing the above, ask clarifying questions about the instructions in class.
Team positives:
1. Speedy and clear communication
2. No disagreement on tasks

I believe that the elements evaluated in usability tests are things discovered in day-to-day usage of the internet, even if subconciously. I did not find this part too difficult, though this is likely a combination of good education and solid industry standards.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
I mentioned in class: the layman loves color.
Even if the end user is unable to understand analyses or technical speak, people are attracted to colorful charts and menus.
