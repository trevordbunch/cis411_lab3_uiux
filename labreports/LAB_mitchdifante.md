# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|

| Site: www.indeed.com | Score:  8/10| Summary: Immediately, Indeed asks the user what job they are looking for and where they wish to work. When a user enters the field they wish to work in and where they want to work, Indeed asks if they wish to add their resume and allows the user to choose an area of work based on what they enter. Additionally, if Indeed cannot find your specific area of work, they find similar jobs to it. It's quick, easy, and gives the user everything they want out of a job search site.|

| ------ | ------- | --------- |

| Site: www.ziprecruiter.com | Score: 5/10| Summary: Ziprecruiter opens to a person named Phil. Phil is an AI personal recruiter that a user can talk to with pre-determined answers. If you don't wish to work with Phil, you can scroll down and type in your area of work and where. Right away, after you press enter, your asked to put in your email to search jobs. This means that you NEED to have an account first. After you type in your email, you need to create an account, and then it send you right back to job search. Overall, Ziprecruiter can be very annoying since it makes users take extra steps in order to do what they wish. |

| Title | LinkedIn & Simplyhired vs. the #1's in job search. |
| Description / Steps | Users will create an account or signin, and use LinkedIn for a certain amount of time, users will go through steps   of navigating LinkedIn and then compare LinkedIn to Ziprecruiter and Indeed. |
| Primary Actor | College students, business owners, people searching for jobs. |
| Preconditions | - User must have small amount of computer profeciency and should know how to access LinkedIn and navigate it. 
                  - User should have knowledge on what these websites are and what they are meant for.
                  - User should navigate around all three websites with confidence and should be able to explain a difference between them.

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [www.linkedin.com](www.awesomesauce.com)
2. Competitor 2 [www.simplyhired.com](www.simplyhired.com)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open up the 4 websites and sign in if you have an account.  | User was able to interact and open up all of the websites with no worries. If not, this will be a failed useability test. |
| 2 | Navigate through the 4 websites and express what they like and don't like about them.   | The users will later be told to rank the websites and then grade them /10. |
| 3 | User should know how to interact with websites, view connections, search for jobs, etc.   | User should spend about 5-10 minutes on each website before grading and moving onto the next.   |
| 4 | User must compare the competitors to Indeed and Ziprecruiter and explain which ones they liked more and why. User must rank each website and score each website /10.  | User should score them based on appearance, easily accessible, easy to navigate, if they would use it more in the future, and how intuitive the sites are.   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open up the 4 websites and sign in if user has an account.  | The user was my roommate, he was able to access these websites easily with no difficulty.   |
| 2 | User should navigate through the 4 websites and express what they like and don't like about them based on first appearance.   | My roommate stated that Indeed was bland and Ziprecruiter was more sleek and interesting. He said LinkedIn was different and he likes it the most and he stated that Simplyhired looked the same as Ziprecruiter and Indeed, just different colors.  |
| 3 | User should go more in depth and interact with the websited, view connections, and search for jobs for about 5-10 minutes on each website.  | My roommate spent the most amount of his time on LinkedIn, he checked his connections, viewed job opportunities, and interacted with his connections. He spent about 7 minutes on the other websites and simply searched numerous jobs on them.   |
| 4 | User must compate the competitors to Indeed and Ziprecruiter, rank each website 1-4 and grade them /10, and explain which ones they liked more and why.  | My roommates ranking went 1. LinkedIn 2. Ziprecruiter 3. Simplyhired 4. Indeed. He gave LinkedIn a 9/10, he liked that is was much more interactive and that he could connect with other people in his field of study. He gave Ziprecruiter a 7/10, he stated that the website looked nice and the job searches came up fast, but he wishes they were more interactive. He gave both Simplyhired and Indeed a 6/10. He stated the same for Ziprecruiter, but also added that the websites were just simply too plain and he wished for more from them.  |


## Step 3.5 Findings
Organize your findings here.

The findings that I have noticed is that there are numerous job search apps out there that do the same thing, but they all do it in different ways that can be more or less effective for the user. It all depends on users computer profeciency and how much time they have. Additionally, users may have different preferences on how websites look and how they should look, this can lead them to trusting websites or not trusting websites and can easily sway their opinions.
