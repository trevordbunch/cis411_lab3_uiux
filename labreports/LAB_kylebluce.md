# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Zip Recruiter | 14 | ZIpRecruiter seemed like a pretty average site to me. It felt similar to Indeed. It did the job well. I liked that it let me upload my resume, to autofill some of my account information. |
| Snagajob | 11 | I am not a big fan of Snagajob. It seemed wordy on some of the steps, and the basic profile creation took longer than I'd like. |

## 2.2 Site 1

![ZipRecruiter1](/labreports/Zip1.png)

This screenshot is the home page of ZipRecruiter. There is no "Create an Account" Button, but the "Get Started" seems to be what they want you to do. They take the location of the user to search jobs in the area. There is a sign-in and post a job button in the top right.

![ZipRecruiter2](/labreports/Zip2.png) 

This is the first step in the account process after clicking Get Started. This would be good for someone who knows exactly what they are looking for.

![ZipRecruiter3](/labreports/Zip3.png) 

This next step is nice because I am currently not looking for work, so it is nice to have that option to click.

![ZipRecruiter4](/labreports/Zip4.png)

This step showed five different jobs that related to my interests, but most of them seemed out of my experience level, so I just skipped through them all.

![ZipRecruiter5](/labreports/Zip5.png) 

This step was really nice because I could upload my resume, although it got some of the information wrong when it translated it to my profile.

![ZipRecruiter6](/labreports/Zip6.png) 

This job search feature is pretty routine. Nothing really stood out to me.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | I felt like it was pretty intuitive. I just would've liked to see a "Create Account" button.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | It didn't take long at all to set up. A detailed profile would take a long time.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | I felt like the site did an okay job of making the important information clear. I wasn't always sure what was important and what wasn't. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | It carried me through the set of steps that were required, so I felt like it made the information clear. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | This site was somewhat wordy in certain spots, but it was good with keeping things concise for the most part.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | Navigating the site seemed pretty intuitive, or I could at least find my way back. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | I couldn't find much about a screen reader and my browser couldn't read the site for me. |
| **TOTAL** | 14  | Overall, I felt like ZipRecruiter was pretty average for a job searching site. |

## 2.3 Site 2
![SnagAJob1](/labreports/Snag1.png)

This is the home page for SnagAJob. I like how it has the "Create a Profile" as well as the quick job search option, but it is confusing what option I should pick. I clicked create a profile.

![SnagAJob2](/labreports/Snag2.png) 

I was not of fan of their profile creation. They didn't have a spot for me to upload my resume. It just seemed very crowded.

![SnagAJob3](/labreports/Snag3.png)

I like that they have a section to put in availability and job interests. This seems like a good site if you really want to spend a lot of time putting in information.

![SnagAJob4](/labreports/Snag4.png) 

I like their job search feature, but it feels very similar to every other job recruiting website.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | I was able to figure it out without any glaring issues. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1 | In order to create a proper profile, it would've taken me twice the amount of time ZipRecruiter took. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | The information was presented well, but the important steps didn't always stand out.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | The site did a good job of leading me through a process of what to do next. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1 | This site was wordy at times. A few of the steps had an entire paragraph explaining what to do. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | I felt like the navigation was similar to any other job search site. It was relatively easy to navigate.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | Again, I couldn't find anything on the site for accessibility or in my browser options. |
| **TOTAL** | 11  | I feel like Snagajob is worse than the average job site. It just doesn't seem as clean and takes too much time. |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Create a Goal |
| Description / Steps | 1. User navigates to the goals tab. </br> 2. User selects the green plus button. </br> 3. User inputs name of goal, type of measurement, and color for the goal. </br> 4. User selects friends to share the goal with. </br> 5. User selects the frequency that the app will check-in on the goal. </br> 6. User selects "Create" to create the goal. |
| Primary Actor | Emotive User |
| Preconditions | The user has an account created with Emotive, and they are currently logged in. |
| Postconditions | The new goal is added to the user's account and shared with friends. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

Competitor Goal Setting App: </br>
**Daylio** [https://daylio.net/](https://daylio.net/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Set Up An Account (Skip Goal Creation)  | Follow the prompts when you open up the app.  |
| 2 | Create A Goal | Navigate to stats, then goals, then create goal and fill in the prompts.  |
| 3 | Log Your Mood From the Past 3 Days | Use the plus button, then select which day and the corresponding mood.  |
| 4 | Open Your Mood Chart | Navigate to stats and select Mood Chart. |
| 5 | Check Out Your Weekly Report | Go to the More tab and select Weekly Reports.  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Set Up An Account (Skip Goal Creation)  | Team Member was able to follow the Account Set-Up very easily.  |
| 2 | Create A Goal | Team Member originally clicked on the Plus Sign which led him to the Mood Logging Page. He then went into the Stats page and found the Create Goal option. |
| 3 | Log Your Mood From the Past 3 Days | Team Member went back to the Plus Sign he found before and inputted his moods without problems. |
| 4 | Open Your Mood Chart | Team Member found the Mood Chart immediately by navigating to the stats section. |
| 5 | Check Out Your Weekly Report | Team Member first scrolled through the Stats section, then went through the Calendar screen, and then found the Weekly Report in More. |

## Step 3.5 Findings

Improvements </br>
-	The Plus Option should have the ability to create a goal instead of just input a mood. </br>
-	The More section seems too vague and should be clearer what is in that section. Maybe it could be called Additional Stats. </br>
-	Creating a goal didn’t really have a way you could measure besides a checkmark system. </br>

Positives </br>
-	The Weekly Report and Mood Chart seemed like good features for users to track their progress. </br>
-	The Emoji based mood tracker seemed like a fun and simple way to keep track of your current mood. Didn’t take too much time. </br>

What Our Team Did Well </br>
-	Picked some simple enough tasks that didn’t take too long to complete and a few complicated tasks that were harder to find. </br>
-	Listened well to the user as they were interacting with the app. </br>
-	
What Could We Improve On? </br>
-	Finding more complicated tasks that involve more specific actions as a way to test how detailed our own app should be. </br>
-	Finding people outside our own team to conduct the usability test. </br>

The Emotive team conducted a Usability test of a common competitor called Daylio. This app is meant for tracking moods and creating goals similar to Emotive. We wanted to find out how simple it was to create a goal and complete a few other tasks on the app. We played around with the app for a bit and discovered interesting features like the Weekly Report and the Mood Chart. Our usability test went well, when one of our team members completed our tasks with only a little bit of difficulty.
