## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| ZipRecruiter | 20 | Very Good |
| Monster | 14 | Mediocre |

## 2.2 ZipRecruiter
![Whole_Page](assets/ziprecruiter_profile.png)
This is the full page of the profile. All of your personal information is listed here and you can make changes and edits to them. I really like this whole layout as it is a very simple and minimalistic layout and all your information is displayed here. 

![Work_Experience](assets/work_experience_zipcruiter,png)
This is where the user can edit the work experience. What I like about this is that the user doesn't HAVE to choose from the list of companies in their database. The user is able to just add whatever name their company has and use that. I really appreciate that as some pages don't allow that. This goes for all the ZipRecruiter screenshots I provide next.

![Education](assets/education_ziprecruiter.png)
This is where the user can edit their education information. As I have stated above, I really like that the user does not have to choose from a list that they have.

![Skills](assets/skills_ziprecruiter)
This is the page where the user can edit their skills.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | The steps when signing up and updating information were very clear on ZipRecruiter. I could see where I needed to click to sign up and update my personal information. The navigation menu was also very simple with only four selections but they basically covered everything you needed. The search bar in the main page (which also is the Jobs page) is right there with a location selector on the right and there are suggested jobs under the search bar based on what major you selected in your profile.   |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | The website did its purpose and did it very well. Everything a user would need was right there to click on. For example, accessing the user's profile, looking for jobs, or looking at messages from potential employers were all within one click of a button. It did not waste time at all. When setting up my profile, everything was in one page and there wasn't much clicking and navigating needed.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | When selecting a job from a job search or from a job search, the job has a description of the job and qualifications and requirements with three buttons at the bottom: "Apply Now", "Check Salary", and "Am I Qualified?" This was very good as it basically told me what I should do and I had other options to check for what I wanted like salary or qualifications. </br></br> When setting up the profile, the website guided me through every step and it only required the important information and enough information was given to know what was needed. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | When signing up for an account and setting up my profile, the website walked me through every step and it had a progress bar at the top of the screen to allow the user to know where the user was in terms of creating a profile. When searching for a job, there was the three buttons that I mentioned above, and those guide the user to select which option they would like.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | The site was excellent in terms of ommitting words because it doesn't have words floating around with ads and other unnecessary buttons and options that would distract the user from doing anything that impedes the user from applying for a job or doing whatever the user needed to do.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | As I have stated before, the four buttons on the navigation bar were really simple but they provided everything that the user would need. The menu items were: Jobs, Salaries, Messages, and Profile. There were three other items like the home button and a notifications button and an options button to access other less frequently used options like account settings and mobile app and support.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | This website did not really have an option for text-to-speech but I am sure there are third party applications for that. As for images, if a company had an image for the job, the image would would alt-text so it gets a 2 out of 3 for me.  |
| **TOTAL** | 20  | The website overall had very good user interface and experience. The website follows every rule by Steve Krug almost perfectly because when going through every process in terms of creating a profile and updating info to searching for jobs. Overall a very pleasant experience.  |

## 2.3 Monster
![Whole_Page](assets/monster_profile.png)
What I really liked about Monster's profile was that I did not have to fill in a single thing. Once I uploaded my resume, the website automatically filled in everything for me. I know that it is pretty common today for job websites to fill it in automatically but Monster did it without errors. That was a huge plus from me. Other than that, it has a nice layout but one thing I dislike was the placement of the experience and education. Personally, those should be higher up so users don't have to scroll down to change those.

![Contact_Information](assets/contact_information_monster,png)
This section is where the user can edit their contact information. It is pretty simplistic and gets the job done. However, there is one thing I do not like about the entire Monster website. And that is the way the font blends in with the colors. There is something but I cannot put my finger on it. It just does not go well together. 

![Skills](assets/skills_monster.png)
This is where the user can edit their skills.

![Work_Experience](assets/experience_monster.png)
This is the page where the user can edit their work experience. Once again, I do not believe that it should be so far down.

![Education](assets/education_monster.png)
This is the page where the user can edit their education. Once again, I do not believe that it should be so far down.


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | The website was pretty intuitive as it basically does what it is supposed to do: help the user find a job. The "above the fold" part of the front page had a huge search bar for the user to search for jobs which was a huge plus if the user only wanted to look for jobs right away. They had popular search terms for jobs right under the search bar for the user to click on so they did not have to type everything out in the search bar.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | The website did value my time as after the pretty short sign up process, I could look for jobs right away and looking up my profile and updating information was not a tough process at all.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | When creating and account and when applying for jobs, it was pretty clear what was important and what was needed when going through these steps in this website. I am deducting a point because it has a little more text and images that might be distractions for users.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | As for leading the user when creating an account or applying for a job, this website did it well enough and it does guide the user to do what they want to do. What I liked about this website is the fact that they had an option for career advice that people who are just getting started with applying for jobs would appreciate.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | While the website offered other resources like career advice and advice on how to get started, there were too many words everywhere for me. ZipRecruiter had everything straight to the point and ready to go while Monster had so many other more potentially unnecessary words around the webpagee.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | While the website generally had good navigation, there was one button that really threw me off. When you are logged in, right next to your profile icon there is a button that is supposed to log you out, however, it did not have any text under it or on it to indicate anything. Normally, logging out of an account would involve clicking on the profile or setting icon to access the log out button or maybe the log out button should be a text instead of an icon. That was the only gripe I had with this website. As for looking up jobs and signing up, this had no problem.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0  | This website gets a bad accessibility rating... None of the images have alt-text in the website.  |
| **TOTAL** | 14  | While the website would be fine for people with no disabilities, it would be a terrible experience for people who have disabilities because it does not cater well towards people with disabilities.  |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1: [Daylio](https://daylio.net/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create an account.   | Download the app, and go through the whole sign-up process.   |
| 2 | Create a goal.   | Right after signing up, go to the "More" tab and select goals and create a goal there.   |
| 3 | Log moods from past three days.   | Click on the plus logo on at the center of the tabs at the bottom of the screen to log mood. There are three different options to choose from. Select one for "Other Day" and log mood for two days ago. Next, select the plus logo again and select "Yesterday" to log yesterday's mood. Lastly, select "Today" to log today's mood.   |
| 4 | Check mood chart.   | Go to the "Stats" tab and scroll down to see the mood chart.   |
| 5 | Access weekly report.   | Click on the "More" tab at the bottom and select "Weekly Reports."  |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create an account.  | 1. Went through the whole sign up process without any problems.  |
| 2 | Create a goal.  | 1. Clicked on the plus icon at the bottom center of the screen trying to create a goal. </br> 2. Did not work out as that was only for logging your mood. </br> 3. However, quickly found out where goal creating was after clicking on the "More" tab at the bottom right. </br> 4. Created goal to drink more water. </br> 5. Selected frequency of check-ins </br> 6. Selected time for reminder. </br> 7. Added a note that says "Get that H2O." </br> 8. Saved note. |
| 3 | Log yesterday's mood.  | 1. Clicked on plus icon at the bottom center of the screen. </br> 2. Clicked on "Yesterday" to log yesterday's mood. Which was "UPSET" </br> 3. Logged Thursday's mood: "RAD." </br> 4. Logged today's mood: "GOOD."  |
| 4 | Check mood chart.  | 1. Clicked on calendar to check mood chart. Failed. </br> 2. Found it on the "Stats" tab.   |
| 5 | Access weekly report.  | 1. Went on more and found the weekly reports there.  |

## Step 3.5 Findings

1. For our application, I believe the usability could be improved by informing our users what our app is about. For Daylio, our competitor, our tester went into it without knowing it was an app for logging moods and so he was so confused about where the goal creating was. 
2. I believe my team did well in terms of going simple. Even though our application is different from our competitors in terms of the social aspect, as that is our competitive edge, we went simple as to just starting low as in only focusing on creating goals. 
3. How our team could improve next time would be how our use case can be more complicated when we confirm more of our applications features.
