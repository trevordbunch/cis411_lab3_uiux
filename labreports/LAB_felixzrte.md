# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 8/10 | Indeed is a very popular job searching site and many employers use it. The website is easy to follow and it is easy to search for jobs. |
| Monster | 9/10 | Monster has a very nice design and I liked them because they had many job listings but they also had many other resources. For example they had resources for people who just graduated to help them find jobs. |

## 2.2 Site 1
![profile](../assets/indeed/indeed.png)
This is my profile for Indeed. It has all the basic info needed for a resume
![step_1](../assets/indeed/step_1.png)
Good landing page and easy to understand what you can do on the site
![step_2](../assets/indeed/step_2.png)
I searched up Web Designer in Mechanicsburg and there were a lot of results for each job listing. I like that it gives you a lot of info on the job listing, and it looks nice design wise.
![step_3](../assets/indeed/step_3.png)
I decided to "apply" for a Web Designer job at West Shore Home
![step_4](../assets/indeed/step_4.png)
They asked me about my web experience
![step_5](../assets/indeed/step_5.png)
They asked me about more web experience and about relocation.
![step_6](../assets/indeed/step_6.png)
They gave me the choice to apply with my Indeed resume or my own resume.

    - We were able to come up with a simple test for the user
