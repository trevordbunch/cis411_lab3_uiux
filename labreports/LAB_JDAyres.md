|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 18/21 | Overall, LinkedIn's Job application UI experience is well-designed and user-friendly, with a few areas for improvement in terms of overwhelming layouts and limited filter options. However, the site values the user's time and provides a straightforward application process, and is designed to be accessible to all users. |
| Indeed | 17/21 | Overall, Indeed's job application UI experience is generally user-friendly and effective, but there are some areas for improvement, such as the cluttered job listing page and the confusing profile completion form.

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to the homepage of indiegospel.net  | The landing page of the site is different from the homepage. |
| 2 | Search for a specific artist or song  | The search function is not super accurate and the page for viewing search results is cluttered and confusing. |
| 3 |  Click on a song or artist to view their page | some artist pages can be confusing. |
| 4 | Navigate to and explore the community section  | Absurdly huge footer, there is also a different navigation bar from the home page.|
| 5 |  Listen to a song or watch a video | The site stops the song once you exit the tab, wish there was an option to keep the song playing in the background. |
| 6 |  Explore the events section and view an upcoming event | There were upcoming events that had already occurred and were not removed from the page. |
| 7 |  Overall evaluation | 4.5/10 Confusing amount of navigation features, doesn't maintain selected song throughout site. Overall, design feels outdates and navigation is clunky. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
**Improvements:**

1. Improve the accuracy of the search function and make the search results page less cluttered and confusing.
2. Simplify the artist pages to make them more user-friendly and less confusing.
3. Streamline the navigation features to make them more intuitive and less overwhelming.

**Experiences:**

1. The ability to listen to songs and watch videos is a benefit to the user, as it allows them to experience the music firsthand and get a better sense of the artist's style.
2. The community section provides a space for users to connect with other fans and share their thoughts and opinions about the music.

**What did our Team do Well:**

I believe that we did a great job communicating with each other and clarifying exactly what we were all looking for in terms of qualities in the site as well as what kind of navigation we want to be looking at.

**How can We Improve:**

One main we I think our team could improve is jumping on group assignments like this sooner. Everything worked out fine this time thankfully, however with future projects it would be a good Idea not to work on the team portion of assignments as a group the last day to work on them.

**My Experience Conducting a Usability Test:**

Overall I really like conducting this, it was fun to hang out with my buddies to figure out what we want to test. It was also just an interesting experience to explore competitors applications, or future applications, and compare them to what we will be doing. I also just enjoyed exploring webpages and finding both good and bad qualities and thinking of ways to improve them. Also, Aidan gave me free pizza which was pretty dope.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
Usability Rule: "Consistency is Key."

Consistency in design is important because it allows users to easily recognize and understand how to interact with a product. When a user sees the same design elements and patterns repeated throughout a product, they can quickly build mental models of how the product works and how to navigate it. This reduces cognitive load and makes the product feel more intuitive and user-friendly. Consistency can be applied to various design elements, such as typography, color schemes, layout, and interaction patterns. By applying consistency in design, we can create a better user experience that is easier to use and more efficient. Inconsistent design can be frustrating and confusing, leading to user frustration and ultimately a poor user experience. Therefore, it is important to strive for consistency in design to create a cohesive and user-friendly product.
