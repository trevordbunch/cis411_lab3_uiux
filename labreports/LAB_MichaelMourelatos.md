# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| **Indeed** | 19 | Indeed is a user-friendly site that gives the users what they want and accommodates people that don't care to make an account with them. They prioritize the job searching and do well with their formatting. Recommend this site to anyone! |
| **Monster** | 20 | I went into using Monster with lower expectations due to never hearing of it before. However, Monster is an efficient site for job searching that also values helping its users. Part of the process of signing up was an option to generate a resume based on the information given. Although taking more time, it was worth the extra time. Monster also keeps a simple approach, and its use of simple colors allows users to use their site with ease. |

## 2.2 Site 1

[Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/):

**Step 1**:

**Description**: Sign up button was clear, and there was a straightforward way to search for jobs.

**Step 2**:

**Description**: Using a specific job search and a specific location to find an optimal job that fits my needs. It was efficient and what I am looking for.

**Step 3**:

**Description**: There was an option to either sign in to an account that was already made or make an account. This process was easy and led me to the next step of uploading a resume.

**Step 4**:

**Description**: I was given an option to upload my resume which is an efficient approach to uploading specific information such as an address, skills, previous jobs, etc.
![Indeed Option to Upload Resume](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/4_Indeed_Option_to_Upload_Resume.png)


**Step 5**:

**Description**: After making an account, Indeed gave me suggestions for other jobs in my area that fall in the category of cybersecurity. This makes my life easier since I will only be looking for cybersecurity jobs, so Indeed just displays those jobs right away.

**Step 6**:

**Description**: When needing to change anything about my account, Indeed has a simple format on how to change any information, review anything, or if you want to quickly view jobs. A simple format and straightforward.

**Step 7**:

**Description**: Indeed allows you to update job preferences and state your job types. These options are considered when going through the job search process. This was easy to do and did not take much time.
![Indeed Job Preferences](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/7_Indeed_Job_Preferences.png)


**Step 8**:

**Description**: A screenshot of what I view for my account that contains my resume, job preferences if I am open to work, and other information. Self-explanatory way of doing things and was not difficult to do. This information was not required or fully necessary when job searching but helps when narrowing down options and applying is more efficient.
![Indeed Profile View](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/8_Indeed_Profile_View.png)


**Step 9**:

**Description**: On the main page of jobs displayed, Indeed provided a link straight to the applying process based on the information I gave Indeed.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Indeed had a lot of straightforward approaches and was easy to follow. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Indeed doesn't require a user to make an account which cuts out steps that would take more time. Only using the site to search for a job nearby was time-efficient. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | The process of finding a job was very clear and easy to do. However, making an account on Indeed wasn't required which could lead to some confusion for some users. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | Finding a job was very easy. I plugged in specific job types and locations and easily found some job options. This was all done on the homepage of Indeed. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | There was quality white space used on Indeed. There was not an overwhelming amount of words on the page which allows more users to read through what is displayed on the page. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | The navigation was easy to walk through. Signing up was easy to find but should be suggested more when operating as a guest on Indeed. However, being a guest or having an account, Indeed was inclusive to both with their services. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | There is not a whole lot going on with the Indeed interface (a small number of options to choose from), so most users should be able to operate easily. |
| **TOTAL**: | 19 ||

## 2.3 Site 2

[Monster.com](https://www.monster.com/):


**Step 1**:

**Description**: The opening display is easy to follow. You can quickly find how to search for jobs or make an account.
![Monster Opening Display](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/1_Monster_Opening_Display.png)

**Step 2**:

**Description**: Easy format to follow what jobs are nearby. Not a lot of clutter going on. A lot of white space makes it easier to read each job opportunity.
![Monster Job Posting from First Search](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/2_Monster_Job_Posting_From_First_Search.png)

**Step 3**:

**Description**: Users are easily able to find the signup/login buttons. Simple format to sign up. Something noteworthy is that the site did not suggest a password which added unnecessary time.
![Monster Making an Account](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/3_Monster_Making_Account.png)

**Step 4**:

**Description**: Was given the option to upload my resume. This helped to speed the process up significantly. Very easy to upload unless you are operating on a mobile device. Unless a user has their resume on their device.
![Monster Option to Upload Resume](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/4_Monster_Option_to_Upload_Resume.png)

**Step 5**:

**Description**: Monster takes information from the user's resume and documents it. Helps further the process along quicker with less work from the user.

![Monster Autofill Information from Resume](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/5_Monster_Autofill_Information_From_Resume.png)

**Step 6**:

**Description**: Monster provided an option to create a resume. I submitted my resume and it offered an extra step in creating a resume. However, this felt unnecessary because it only just reformatted the resume I already submitted.
![Monster Creating New Resume](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/6_Monster_Creating_New_Resume.png)

**Step 7**:

**Description**: The profile that Monster gives is easy to follow and still displays the opportunity to search for jobs easily. There isn't much going on so it is easy to stay focused when on the site.
![Monster Jobs Profile View](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/7_Monster_Profile_View.png)

**Step 8**:

**Description**: Searching for a job was completed very easily and quickly. I was given enough information from the surface level to understand the job. There was a link to apply if I was interested. It was all time-efficient.
![Monster Jobs Looking for Jobs](/Screenshots%20for%20Job%20Searches/8_Moster_Looking_for_Job.png)

**Step 9**:

**Description**: I was taken straight to the application page, and I was not expected or required to do any other clicks before trying to start applying.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Monster was straightforward, had just enough words to properly explain what was going on, and was easy to navigate. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time? | 2 | The site, while easy to follow did have a couple of instances that felt unnecessary when making an account and filling out the information, even when you uploaded your resume. However, if you don't make an account and only use the site for job searching, time shouldn't feel wasted. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3| All steps were clear and easy to find. There is not much going on with the page, so it is difficult to become overwhelmed or lost. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | I was able to easily find jobs with no hassle and did not have to go through multiple steps to find job opportunities. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | There were a small number of words going on on the Monster site showing the site values white space but still gives enough information for users to be interested. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | Making an account and job searching was very easy to do and did not take long to do. Despite the remaking of my resume, for users that do not have a resume made and only plugged the information into the website, this tool is very beneficial. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | This site is very clean-looking and would not be difficult to operate on a mobile device. Monster has a small number of options on its site. They prioritize job searches which help eliminate clutter. |

## Step 3.2 Identify a Competitive Product

**List of Competitors**:

Competitor 1 [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Create Account | To best way to utilize the application is to create an account first. |
| **2** | Either Turn on Location Services or Manually Enter Location | Turning on location allows the application to work more efficiently, so the user does not always have the manually enter their location. |
| **3** | Search for Church Nearby | Conducting the actual search to find a church near the user. |
| **4** | Scroll Through Output and Find Church Information that Fits User's Preference | ChurchSearch will provide information about churches nearby for the user to view. |
| **5** | Select Desired Church | If the user finds the church they possibly want to attend, they can select it and learn more information about the church. |
| **6** | Logout | Logout after being done with the application. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create Account | The user was able to create an account once navigating to the "Create Account" button. |
| 2 | Either Turn on Location Services or Manually Enter Location | The user was given a pop-up that had them turn on location services to allow ChurchSearch to use their location. |
| 3 | Search for Church Nearby | The user easily navigated to the search bar and successfully searched for nearby churches. |
| 4 | Scroll Through Output and Find Church Information that Fits User's Preference | The user was able to scroll through the output of churches and scan through which churches would potentially interest them. |
| 5 | Select Desired Church | The user was able to find a church that they were interested in and selected it to learn new information. |
| 6 | Logout | The user successfully logged out. |

## Step 3.5 Findings

**Cons**:
1. The user did not like how the results were not in order of distance
2. A filter would have been beneficial to the searching process

**Pros**:
1. History under search bar was helpful to find previous searches
2. Turning on location services was easy due to being asked via a pop-up and only needing to click a button

**Overview**: Overall the user had a good experience, and our group set the user up for a fairly easy test run. The user's feedback was beneficial and honest and will be great for our group to consider moving forward. Not much was expected from our users on their first try, and they were able to complete the task with ease. Our group considered this trial a success, and we are eager to make positive changes moving forward.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
If you opt to do extra credit, then include it here:

No one likes clutter. When you navigate to a new web page, it is difficult to stay focused on what the main point of the page is or find the necessary information you are looking for when there are a bunch of images, links to other sites, or if the information doesn’t have white space. Applications or websites that utilize white space and an overall simplicity look to their page better enhance a user’s experience.
