# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 19.5 / 21 | Overall, highly intuitive, clear directions, well designed, easy to use. Feed can be somewhat distracting from other tasks. |
| Handshake | 19.0 / 21 | Overall, highly intuitive, clear directions. Some places to improve in design. Easy to use, specifically designed for college students' job searches. |

## 2.2 Site 1 - LinkedIn (preferred)
Job Search Process with Screenshots & Steps:

*Note - I already have an account on this site and will be proceeding with the following steps under that assumption.

The process of getting to my profile to add/update skills is as follows (from LinkedIn home page):  
1. Enter credentials and select "Sign in."
2. Click the drop-down arrow under "Me" in the top right.
3. Select "View Profile."
4. Scroll down to the "Skills" section.
5. To add skills - Select the + button.
6. Type a skill in the search box.
7. Select a skill from the drop-down menu.
8. Click "Save" to add the skill to your profile.
9. To update skills - Select the pencil button.
10. Select the pencil button beside any skill to update where it is used or delete the skill.
11. Select "Save" to save the change to your profile.

![Adding Skills to LinkedIn](/assets/linkedin_skills.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-t-b781a722b/edit/forms/skills/new/?profileFormEntryPoint=PROFILE_SECTION

This is intuitive, easy - users do not have to come up with titles of skills on their own, offerins some level of standardization - and convenient. The skills section is fairly far down the profile page, which might make it difficult to find.

### Job Search Detailed Steps

#### Step 1 - Go To LinkedIn Home Page
![LinkedIn Home Page - Login Screen](/assets/linkedin_login.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/

The home page displays the sign-in and account creation options prominently and clearly. It is intuitive and directs the user toward a specific action.

I like how the user does not need to search for the login or account creation buttons - all of these options are clear and intuitive. The screen is not crowded with unnecessary words.

#### Step 2 - After Logging In
![LinkedIn Feed](/assets/linkedin_after_login.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?trk=homepage-basic_sign-in-submit

LinkedIn brings up a feed immediately after the user logs in. It encourages the user to scroll through that feed, but also has a clear menu at the top to navigate to other portions of the site - for instance, viewing your network, searching for jobs, or messaging other users.

I like that LinkedIn offers the user multiple options - since there are many ways to use the site - after logging in. However, I would change the default landing page. Scrolling through this feed is rarely useful, while job searching and growing your network are. This page is fairly busy and might sidetrack users who want to accomplish a specific task.

#### Step 3 - Jobs Home Page
![LinkedIn Jobs Home Page - Suggested jobs, menu bar](/assets/linkedin_jobs_home.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/

LinkedIn offers several paths for a user to take from this page. The most direct option - highlighted front and center - is to search jobs usng one of LinkedIn's quick suggestions.

Users can also choose from a variety of options on the left side to prepare for job hunting, scroll through LinkedIn's recommended jobs, or participate in recommended activities on the right.

I like that LinkedIn offers a variety of options and prep opportunities, but highlights actual jobs right away to let users begin their job search. Advertising for resume writers detracts from this - in my opinion, it should be to one side and not in the center.

#### Step 4 - Search For A Job
![LinkedIn Job Search Results](/assets/linkedin_job_search.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3457242351&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true

Searching for a particular job displays results quickly and in an intuitive way. Filters are at the top, just below the search bar, jobs are listed on the left, and more detail for each job is listed on the right.

I like the way this site offers easy filtering, job lists, and more details taking up a large portion of the screen. One thing I dislike is how many of the jobs listed near the top are not entry level - this requires the user to do more work adding filters and scrolling through long lists of jobs to find applicable positions.

#### Step 5 - Refine Search
![LinkedIn Job Search Filter - Boxes Checked for Full-Time, Remote](/assets/linkedin_jobs_filter.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3457241546&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true

Next, I used the filter feature to refine search criteria. This seemed intuitive and offered relevant filter options. It allows the user to search more quickly and therefore values the user's time.

One useful feature to add might be allowing users to save their filter options to be applied automatically in future job searches.

![LinkedIn Job Search Filter - Adding Filter for Experience Level](/assets/linkedin_jobs_filter2.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3517219677&f_JT=F&f_WT=2&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true&sortBy=R

I needed to add an additional filter for experience level after searching based on the initial filter. This added step takes time and should have been included in the first set of filter options.

#### Step 6 - View Updated Results
![LinkedIn List of Filtered Jobs](/assets/linkedin_updated_jobs.png)

URL: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3351948625&f_E=2&f_JT=F&f_WT=2&keywords=entry%20level%20security%20engineer&refresh=true&sortBy=R

Again, this offers excellent detail and an intuitive list of jobs and filter options. There is a clear option for the user to apply to the listed job, and an additional option to save the job. This call to action is effectively placed.

The first job is not applicable to the search or my profile, but that may be due to relatively narrow search criteria. However, this is something that could be improved.

#### Step 7 - Apply for Job
![Home Depot - Job Application](/assets/linkedin_apply.png)

URL: https://careers.homedepot.com/job/17799163/cybersecurity-analyst-ii-remote-atlanta-ga/?utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=corporate&utm_medium=social_media&utm_content=job_posting&utm_term=ta_-jobwrap%2Fslots&ss=paid

Selecting the "Apply" button directs the user to the company's website to submit an application. This is a helpful way to direct the user to the place where they can continue the application process.

This page also has an orange, obvious button calling users to apply. It employs simple, intuitive headings and appears to be a user-friendly site.



| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2.5  | - Effective headings, navigation, etc. on most pages - easy to see where to go/what to do<br/><br/>-Some pages - such as feed page - busy/crowded; potentially distracting  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2.5 | - Effective use of space, directions, filters, etc. to make searching for jobs faster<br/><br/>- Like all social media, endless streams of posts & job opportunities make it easy to waste time |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  3 | - Headings, menu options (Jobs, Network, Home, etc.), job filters, job info & application path all obvious and clear to user  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | - Steps clear: Login or create account buttons obvious, Jobs menu button obvious, search bar/filters for jobs obvious, Apply button obvious<br/><br/>-Tendency to strongly encourage user to be logged in (to collect data), consider upgrading, report to LinkedIn if applying for a job, and otherwise take actions to benefit LinkedIn  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  2.5 | - In general concise<br/><br/>- Feed - too many words/options; potentially distracting from other tasks  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | - Navigation clear -Obvious login, menu bar, job search filters, and Apply button  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | - Based on LinkedIn's claims at https://www.linkedin.com/accessibility the site is accessible to screen readers. I was unable to test this without installing special extensions.<br/><br/>- I attempted to navigate the site using only a keyboard and found it fairly intuitive - elements were clearly in focus when I tabbed onto them, and pressing Enter allowed me to select those elements.  |
| **TOTAL** | 19.5  | - Overall, LinkedIn provides a good user experience for a job search   |

## 2.3 Site 2 - Handshake (not preferred)
Job Search Process with Screenshots & Steps:

*Note - I already have an account on this site and will be proceeding with the following steps under that assumption.

Steps to get to profile and add/update skills:  
1. Log in as indicated below.
2. From home page - select your initials in the upper right hand corner.
3. Select "My Profile."
4. Scroll down until the "Skills" section appears on the left.
5. Search for skills in the search bar.
6. Select a skill from the results list to add it to your profile.

![Handshake Add Skills Page](/assets/handshake_skills.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/users/18465462

Like LinkedIn, this is an easy, intuitive way to add skills to your profile. Handshake generates names of skills for you, so users do not have to come up with good phrasing themselves. However, it is far down on the profile page and on the left, not in the center with things like experience and education - potentially overlooked by users.

### Job Search Detailed Steps

#### Step 1 - Log In
![Handshake Login through Messiah University](/assets/handshake_login.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/login

This login page is simple and intuitive - Handshake integrates with Messiah to allow students to sign in easily. Users who are logged in to Messiah already will not need to sign in, but other users will be redirected to Messiah's login page (not pictured here). The large blue button provides an obvious call to action, and other options include signing up for an account and downloading an app.

#### Step 2 - Home Page
![Handshake Home Page](/assets/handshake_home.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu

This page offers clear calls to action - attending an event and making your profile stand out - but is also fairly busy. Useful information is contained beneath the banner, covering most of the page, about reaching out to employers, but it is blocked by this banner and the popup about installing the app.

I would decrease the size of the banner so that potential jobs and other recommendations are visible, and also make sure the popup about installing the app does not block any content.

#### Step 3 - Jobs Home Page
![Handshake Jobs Home Page](/assets/handshake_jobs_home.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings

I clicked the "Jobs" menu option at the top left to reach this page. This seemed clear and intuitive.

Several positives about this page include that it offers a clear search bar and filters, lists jobs to the left in the normally accepted way, and includes more detail to the right. Additionally, it automatically searched for cybersecurity internships based on my profile.

There is a lack of contrast on this page that offers an area for improvement. Also, there is no direct call to action ("Apply" button) until you scroll farther down.

#### Step 4 - Adjusting Filters
![Handshake Jobs list with filters](/assets/handshake_jobs_filtered.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&job.remote=true&job.job_types%5B%5D=9&job.job_types%5B%5D=3&employment_type_names%5B%5D=Full-Time

The offered filters are intuitive and clear. They are geared specifically toward college students, offering filters for things like distance to campus and willingness to interview on campus. This is particularly helpful for a college student and offers a benefit over a more generic tool like LinkedIn.

#### Step 5 - Apply
![Handshake Application Popup Window](/assets/handshake_apply.png)

URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu/postings?page=1&per_page=25&sort_direction=desc&sort_column=default&job.remote=true&job.job_types%5B%5D=9&job.job_types%5B%5D=3&employment_type_names%5B%5D=Full-Time

This offers clear instructions on next steps, obvious buttons to continue the process, and uses simple and concise language.




| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | - Offered clear headings, buttons, etc. as well as directions to next important task  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  |  - This site focused specifically on college students looking for internships/jobs, so it did not waste time on other things |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  | - The home page was somewhat poorly designed - the large welcome banner hid important content lower down, and app installation popup obsucred some of the content<br/><br/>- Also, users need to scroll down to find the "Apply" button for a given job  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | - Yes, this site focuses on the job search and most of the headings/buttons are directed to leading users along this path   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |2.5   | - Effective at omitting words<br/><br/>- Login page busy compared to LinkedIn  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |2.5   |- The site's navigation via menu bars, buttons, search boxes, etc. was effective<br/><br/>- Potentially make "Apply" button visible without scrolling down  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  3 | - Again, based on Handshake's claims at https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049932314-Virtual-Accessibility-in-Handshake its website is accessible to screen readers and also supports keyboard-only use.<br/><br/>- I tested navigating the website using only the keyboard and found it fairly intuitive - I was able to navigate between and select page elements. Testing a screen reader would require installing a special extension.  |
| **TOTAL** | 19  | - Overall, Handshake also provides a good user experience for a job search, especially one geared toward colelge students  |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title |Visitor Accesses Exhibit Details Using QR Code|
| Description / Steps |1. User chooses exhibit (physically).<br/>2. User selects "Scan Code" option.<br/>3. QR code scan is initiated & completed.<br/>4. A new page is displayed with exhibit-specific content associated with that QR code.<br/>5. The app logs that this user has viewed the content for this exhibit. |
| Primary Actor |Visitor to Oakes Museum |
| Preconditions |1. User is logged into the app.<br/>2. User is on tour home page.<br/>3. User has given app camera permissions. |
| Postconditions |1. Exhibit-specific content is displayed.<br/>2. App registers that user has visited that exhibit - marked as complete on list of all exhibits. |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product
Use Case: Visitor accesses exhibit-specific information by scanning a QR code on/near the exhibit.

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 -  [PocketSights](https://pocketsights.com/) (Used for test)
2. Competitor 2 - [visiTour](https://www.studentbridge.com/visitour/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Starting on home page of PocketSights website - Navigate to a tour given a specific title ("Pella's Gorgeous Gardens").   | Normally this would be done on a GPS-enabled phone while physically on site, but this offers a usability test of the Web version for remote users.  |
| 2 | Navigate to information about Brinkhoff Park.  | This is a stop about three-quarters way through the tour and simulates a user looking for information about a specific site.  |
| 3 | Locate Brinkhoff Park on the in-site map.  | This requires users to go back a page and locate the map, which may potentially be a point of frustration.  |
| 4 | Read more about the ninth stop on the tour.  | This can be done in multiple ways - selecting the point on the map, scrolling down to the ninth step, or clicking a link for another page dedicated to only that site.  |
| 5 | Determine what organization created this tour.  |The organization - Visit Pella - is listed at the top in small font.   |
| 6 |Navigate to the place where comments on this tour would be displayed.  | The tour does not actually have any comments, but finding the place where they are located is intuitive.  |
| 7 | Change to a satellite view and zoom in on tour stop 10.  | This is a fairly intuitive use of the map.  |
| 8 | Using the map, determine whether tour stops 1 and 2 are within walking distance of each other.  | They are.  |
| 9 | Navigate to a page with information specific to tour stop 1 through the map.  | It is possibly not completely obvious that you can do this through the map rather than scrolling down and picking a link.  |
| 10 | Determine where this tour is (city and state). | The tour is in Pella, Iowa.  |
| 11 | Visit what you feel is the most interesting or engaging part of the site.  | This may give feedback for what parts of our project we should focus on most. |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Starting on home page of PocketSights website - Navigate to a tour given a specific title ("Pella's Gorgeous Gardens").   | Hard to find tour from main page - lots of competing paths for people interested in making tours, viewing tours, making accounts, etc.<br/>Once on Latest Tours tab easy to find - search box clear and effective |
| 2 | Navigate to information about Brinkhoff Park.  | Easy to find<br/>Convenient links for each stop on the tour in intuitive location  |
| 3 | Locate Brinkhoff Park on the in-site map.  | Takes time to get back to previous page to get to map; better if link were on info page  |
| 4 | Read more about the ninth stop on the tour.  | Easy to find - link in intuitive place  |
| 5 | Determine what organization created this tour.  | Not too hard to find - at top in intuitive location  |
| 6 |Navigate to the place where comments on this tour would be displayed.  | In natural comments place at bottom<br/>Intuitive; in keeping with convention  |
| 7 | Change to a satellite view and zoom in on tour stop 10.  | Easy - normal Google Maps interface; in keeping with convention |
| 8 | Using the map, determine whether tour stops 1 and 2 are within walking distance of each other.  | Easy - normal Google Maps interface; in keeping with convention |
| 9 | Navigate to a page with information specific to tour stop 1 through the map.  | Easy - Google Maps interface integrated with site-specific photos/details in intuitive way  |
| 10 | Determine where this tour is (city and state). | At top of page - good place |
| 11 | Visit what you feel is the most interesting or engaging part of the site.  |Main page for the tour with all the stops listed and map present |

#### Additional Questions Asked After Usability Test:
<u>Most frustrating part:</u>  
Finding tours from home page - "Latest Tours" tab is ambiguous - could mean your personal most recent tours.

<u>Best part:</u>  
Having all tour stops listed along with map all on same page for a given tour.

<u>One thing to change:</u>  
Add a "Search Tours" bar clearly on home page.

## Step 3.5 Findings
#### Improvements:
* Add "Search Tours" bar clearly on the home page. This would allow users to easily search for tours and avoid ambiguity in the "Latest Tours" tab name.

* Embed the Google Map interface on the page specific to each individual stop - highlighting the stop in question - as well as on the overall tour page. This would save users time and hassle moving back and forth between the pages.

* Include the number associated with each tour stop on the list of links to the right and on each stop-specific page. These numbers are used to identify stops on the map, and users already on a stop-specific page won't want to scroll down on the main page to find the stop number.

#### Beneficial Experiences:
* Once on "Latest Tours" tab - obvious, clear search bar with instructions on how to search for tours. This clearly directs the user, aligns with convention, and prevents the user from needing to think too much.

* On main tour-specific page - Google Maps interface embedded with pictures, tour stop numbers, and additional details if the user clicks on a picture. Users are familiar with Google Maps, so this is an excellent and easy-to-use feature.

#### Additional Questions:
Our team collaborated on finding a potentially competitive service for our usability test, but worked independently after that. One thing that went well in this usability test was getting a clear picture of several areas of improvement and excellence for our competitor's site. Some takeaways are that familiar interfaces or features are a plus and that users like obvious paths and direction. A second thing that went well was being able to monitor and ask for feedback from a volunteer who had inisghtful observations about the site, offering good experience for future tests on our own application.

One thing to improve for next time is potentially using a mobile app since that is more directly comparable to our own project. The problem here is that testing such an app is only really comparable to our project if we are in the physical location the tour covers, which was not practical for this test. However, users of our app - or a PocketSights tour - would not struggle with finding tours from the home page of the website, since they would have the app installed and be physically walking around following the tour. Additionally, I might screen record the user (with permission) to gain more information about what is frustrating, intuitive, or engaging.

Overall, this usability test went well. I learned that directing the user along intuitive paths and offering familiar features are key to the user experience. I also gained experience working with a volunteer on a usability test. Things to improve include conducting the test on a mobile platform and using screen recording to gather information.

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
Pithy usability rule:

Users are extraterrestrials.

Designers should carefully consider assumptions they make about the way users think. Just like many sci-fi books and movies explore sapient life that thinks in completely different ways from us - undermining many of our own assumptions - designers should assume that users cannot be relied upon to see the "obvious" path or make a natural leap in logic the way that the developers do. Conclusions about users should be based on data gathered during usability tests or in other ways, not based on designers assuming that users will think like them. It is impossible to avoid generalizations, but the average user may think and navigate a website in a completely different way from how the designer would do it.
