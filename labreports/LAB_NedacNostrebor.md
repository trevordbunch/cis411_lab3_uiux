# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed.com | 21 | it was very easy to create a profile on Indeed thanks to the walk through process they have for filling out all the necessary information. They let you import your resume too and they transfer the info into your online resume that you can edit. The home page is pretty empty, but I think it helps make it less confusing what you need to do. I really liked the Job search page. It is really easy to scroll through all the job options close to you and to see all the information about them. The process to apply for a job was also really easy because they used a walkthrough process just like the profile creator. |
| Monster.com | 19 | It was easy to create a profile although the website was a bit more hands off then Indeed was. I do think the website does look better with its design then Indeed although it is a bit more cluttered which isn't inherently bad. I do think the job search process is worse, since it doesn't tell you as much job information up front and all you have to go off of is the name and position.|

## 2.2 Site 1
Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps.
[Indeed Home Page](../NedacNostreborAssets/IndeedHomePage.JPG)
Somewhat plain, but easy to navigate
[Indeed Profile Creation](../NedacNostreborAssets/IndeedProfileCreation.JPG)
Very easy to use due to the help the website gives
[Indeed Jobs](../NedacNostreborAssets/IndeedJobs.JPG)
Gives a lot of information up front and is easy to search through a large amount of jobs

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3 |  Walked me through almost every step and was quick and easy. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 | allowed you to skip most steps and gives you information for all the jobs up front.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | The pages aren't cluttered and are pretty straight forward. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | It had a very straightforward path to follow |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | With things like the job search they only used the words What and where for job and location, and then had smaller descriptions of what you should put in each box |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |3   | There weren't many stray paths to get lost on  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  |  It seemed fairly accessible with how little clutter there was. |
| **TOTAL** |  21 |   |

Similar to indeed although doesn't show the salary up front.

|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  |  There was a bit more clutter but not enough to matter. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  3 |  The site is very similar to indeed and fast to maneuver. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  |   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2 |  Had a little less instruction then Indeed |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 |  Everything was pretty straightforward |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  pretty straightforward |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Add new event |
| Description / Steps | The user must select the loop, time, place, date, and place for the event |
| Primary Actor | A user|
| Preconditions | The user has created an account and logged in |
| Postconditions | The even is added to the list of available events and becomes searchable |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)
2. Competitor 2 [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Usability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | create an account/login  | If you do not have an account you will need to create one, otherwise login |
| 2 | create an event | click on the create event button to be taken to a page where you can enter the event info |
| 3 | enter event information | fill out a form with all the event information and click confirm when done |
| 4 | confirm event is created | The application should take you to a page with the completed event and/or give you a confirmation that it was completed |


## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create an account  | Creating a facebook account was fairly easy besides having some trouble with email verification |
| 2 | Create an event  | Went to the facebook hotbar and clicked on the plus and then the create event button  |
| 3 | Enter event information | They tried to edit the preview before realizing they needed to change the form on the left |
| 4 | confirm event is created | it goes directly to the created event page |


## Step 3.5 Findings
Organize your findings here.
- Improvements
  - I wish the preview was smaller or there was an option to see the preview because it looks like what you should be editing
  - There should be a big conformation pop up after you create the event
  - You should be able to invite people to the event from the form

- Benefits
  - The preview of what it looked like was nice
  - The location chooser tool made it a lot easier to choose a location

- I think the usability test covered pretty much every step they went through.
- I would probably make the usability test more specific next time and add more steps.
- It was interesting watching someone else do something while focusing on the person's actions rather than what they were doing. It made things stand out that normally wouldn't have.
