# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [*] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [*] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed.com | 17 | Indeed.com had alot of places to click. I had to think about where I want to go with the flood of information. When I did find where I wanted to go I knew what would happen next. I think that Indeed needs to cut down on the amount of information on the home page. |
| Ziprecruiter.com | 13 | Their home page was very simple with not alot of words on the front page. I did have to stroll down to find the search bar for finding a job. I think that the seach bar should be the first thing I see but overall very simple and easy to use. They could use some work on the mobile side of the site. |

## 2.2 Site 1


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1  | I had to think about what I wanted to do because I was flooed with too many choices on the home page.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | Right on the home page I had job listing ready to go. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |  The site took me right into job posting and the job posting had clear information on what the job was.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1  |  Just showed me information which did not lead me anywhere. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  |   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 1 | There were just to much information for it to be easily navigated. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2 |  The site did get the information formated differently on my phone however even with the smaller screen I was still overwelled by the amount of information. |
| **TOTAL** | 13  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2


| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  |  I did not have to think at all the home page was very simple with little information. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 1 | It ask me for more information than I was willing to give it. I just wanted to get to the job listing.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | The steps where very clear |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  3 | Because it asked me so many questions it did give me very personal job listings that were better suited for what I was looking for  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  |   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 |  It was very easy to navigate |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  1 |  The site was not user friendly for phones. The formatting seemed off because it was the same as the desktop excepted the spacing made me scroll alot. |
| **TOTAL** |  17 |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 |  |
|---|---|
| Title | Posting a product |
| Description / Steps | 1. Click on the ***sell*** item button. <br> 2. The user selects the type of item they want to sell from a list of categories. <br> 3.

The user will add a title, description and the price of the item they want to sell. <br> 5. the user reviews the listing and clicks ***post*** to make the item visable to others. <br>|
| Primary Actor | Messiah Student |
| Preconditions | 1. Have a messiah account. <br> 2. Be logged into the app. <br> 3. The user must have an item to list with a photo and description to go along with it. <br>|
| Postconditions | The user will have an item to sell <br> |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Slingshot](https://messiah.slingshotedu.com/#/welcome)
2. Competitor 2 [Facebook marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to Facebook Marketplace |   |
| 2 | Create and log in to an account  |   |
| 3 | Find a lawn mower to purchase  |   |
| 4 | Save the lising they are interested in.  |   |
| 5 | Go back to the home page.  |   |
| 6 | Go back to the saved listing.  |   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Navigate to Facebook Marketplace | type it into google took the user right to facebook marketplace. |
| 2 |  Create and log in to an account | auto logged in to user account. |
| 3 |  Find a lawn mower to purchase | user went right for the search bar and click on the first lawmower they saw which cost 20 dollars. |
| 4 |  Save the lising they are interested in. | The save button was right there so they clicked it.   |
| 5 |  Go back to the home page. | They hit the back arrow on their phone  |
| 6 |  Go back to the saved listing. | My user already knew how to get to their saved listings but I would have taken longer to get there. My user clicked the menu button and their listing for a lawn mower showed up there.   |

## Step 3.5 Findings
I think that it is important to note that my user already uses facebook marketplace. I was not expecting how few clicks it took my user to complete all of the steps. The test took them about 30 seconds to complete. Most of the time was spent with me telling them what to do and the site loading.
