# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 17 | LinkedIn provides users with a easy way to sign in/create accounts and to search for jobs. The use of clear and simple headers allow for quick movement throughout the website.  |
| Handshake | 18 | Handshake utilizes white space and short heading to make it easy for the user to read and more quickly throughout the website. Instructions are clear and concise so the user can create their profile and apply to jobs as best as they can   |

After selecting a skill the user then must provide where they used it. Linkedin provides location based off of other filled out sections.
![skill display](../assets/Screenshot%202023-03-18%20125800.png)
Linkedin shows that it has been added and allows users to add another before going back to the overview of their profile

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  |Has clear headers to guide user to the correct location.<br> Important buttons where a different color to catch users attention  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  |The allowed user to connect different accounts to quicken sign in times.   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2  |Made clear headers and bolded or made them bigger to stand out. <br> Made important buttons simple images or different colors to make it easier to understand their purpose.   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  |There are many different paths the user can take but linkedin does a good job making each of those paths very straight forward   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |3   |All headers or commands are shortened to one or two words   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |2   |Easy to navigate through the different pages.<br> Tricky at first to understand how to find jobs as the jobs button in the nav bar doesn't take you to all the jobs. The user must use the search bar to be able to find all of them and be able to filter them|
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |2   |The formatting of the headers makes it easy for screen readers. Although many of the job posting are not always easily accessible|

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title |User selects and views museum exhibit|
| Description / Steps |1. User opens app and scans QR code. They can also just use dropdown menus in the app to find the correct exhibit they are looking for.<br> 2. The user is then brought to the correct exhibit page where relevant information is display such as descriptions, pictures and audio|
| Primary Actor |Museum guests that have smartphones|
| Preconditions |The user must have the app downloaded<br> reliable internet connection  |
| Postconditions |The user is able to view pictures of the exhibit as well was information about it |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [www.pocketsights.com](https://pocketsights.com/)
2. Competitor 2 [gettysburg-battle-auto-tour](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gettysburg-battle-auto-tour/id1505770574)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |Create Account   |Allows user to sign in using external accounts. User can also Provide a email or just browse as a quest|
| 2 |Select an exhibit  |User can use drop downs to find a specific exhibit to view and learn more about the exhibit  |
| 3 |Take virtual tour   |User are able to select a specific tour they would like to go one. It should also track where they are at in the tour   |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |Create Account   |Test user was able to complete this task.<br> They were pleased that they could just browse as a guest and not need to sign in.    |
| 2 |Select an exhibit   |It took a little bit of the test user to find the desired exhibit.<br> They were frustrated that they had to go through a virtual tour first to then be able to select the individual exhibits.    |
| 3 |Take virtual tour   |It was easy for the test user to complete this task. <br> All tours were provided to the user as soon as they signed it.<br> They like that when they listened to the virtual tour it gave them direction on where to walk not kist read about the exhibits.<br> They didn't expect there to be a transcript for the audio tour but where happy that one was provided.   |

## Step 3.5 Findings
Two things that benefited the user in the workflow was the ability for them to sign in as a quest and also the transcripts for the virtual tour. Signing in as a quest saved the user time and also didn't make them worry about having to sign up for another thing that they may not want anymore after the tour. The transcripts were useful because if the user didn't wasn't to listen or couldn't they could just read and quickly move on to the next exhibit. There are three thing that could be improved for the workflow. The first one being keeping the exhibits separate from the virtual tour so that the user can view each one in any order they want. Second is adding more whitespace so that the pages are easier for the user to read. Lastly is to make the transcript part of the exhibit page not a button the user has to hit just to save time and confusion. Conducting a Useability Test was tricky because we never knew how the test user would react when going through the app. Something that you thought would work well and make it easier for the user ended up actually making it harder because they had to learn something new to continue.
