## Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup

- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

## Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

### 2.1 Summary

| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [Indeed](https://indeed.com) | 19/21 | Well-designed but the initial setup process took a lot more time than it needed to. |
| [Monster](https://monster.com) | 18/21 | Also well-designed, with a style a bit more interesting than Indeed, but the accessibility was lacking. |

### 2.2 Site 1: Indeed

#### [Homepage](https://indeed.com)

![Homepage](/assets/indeed1.png)
I like that the site does not require an account just to search for jobs and that the first page shown is the search page. The link to sign in at the top is in an intuitive location.

#### [Login page](https://secure.indeed.com/account/login?hl=en_US&co=US&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indeed.com%2F&tmpl=desktop&service=my&from=gnav-util-homepage&jsContinue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indeed.com%2F&empContinue=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.indeed.com%2Fmyaccess)

![Login](/assets/indeed2.png)
The login page has everything it needs: the text prompts, options to sign in with existing services (Google, Apple, Facebook), as well as an option to create a new account and a 'forgot password' link at the bottom of the page. I chose to sign in with Google.

#### Resume Upload

(I forgot to save the URL for this before submitting and couldn't get back to it)
![resume upload](/assets/indeed3.png)
This page is simple and gets its job done well, though I am not sure what the process looks like for creating a new resume, since I decided to upload my current resume instead.

#### [Resume Final Touches](https://my.indeed.com/resume?from=login&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indeed.com%2F)

![resume final touches](/assets/indeed4.png)
I like the success message at the bottom that lets me know that my file went through, as well as the details that it extracted to further convince me. I then chose to convert file to an Indeed Resume, as that was the recommended option.

#### [Resume Conversion](https://my.indeed.com/resume/wizard/review/profile)

![resume conversion](/assets/indeed5.png)
I have no complaints about this page - it let me update and complete the fields that the site wanted in order to best offer me jobs and simplify the application process further. I followed this process through the 5 outlined steps (which were very clearly demonstrated beforehand)
![skills](/assets/indeed6.png)
This prompt here was particularly nice. It let me add skills that employers would be looking for with one click rather than manually having to type them out. I have found that being given options to chose from is quite preferable over having to come up with them on my own.

#### [Resume Review](https://my.indeed.com/additionalinfo/resume_review?src=0&setPublic=1)

![review](/assets/indeed7.png)
This page is also designed well. The only thing I would change about it is to add another copy of the "save and continue" button at the bottom of the page (it is a rather long page). This would save users the trouble of having to scroll all the way back to the top after reviewing all of the info on the way to the bottom of the page. I also realized that Indeed had read my address as SC instead of MD somehow, so I changed that.

#### [Profile](https://my.indeed.com/p/micahj-pidj2ni)

![profile](/assets/indeed8.png)
This is the profile page. At first I was not sure if I was still in the previous form, since it blends the information you've already given it with prompts for more information, so I'm not the biggest fan of that.

#### [Job Search](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=internship+summer+2021&l=)

![job search](/assets/indeed9.png)
This page looks good as well. The results are displayed clearly and the relevant information is presented as well. There is a lot of information but the page does not look too cluttered with it.

#### [Job Selected](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=software%20development%20internship%20summer%202021&l&vjk=9d2ea2c80ba682ec)

![job selected](/assets/indeed10.png)
Selecting a job brings up more information in the side panel. I much prefer this to being sent to another page with the job information, so that I don't have to worry about losing my scroll position when going back to the job list. Having the information on the side like this is intuitive and helpful. From here, I can click 'apply on company site' to be redirected to the company's application portal.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | The site is well-designed and professional looking; and it is clear what it expects me to do.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | I had to spend a significant amount of time reviewing and updating information before I could find jobs.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | Information about jobs was presented well, with important info showed on the job card and more in-depth information displayed for the selected job.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | The flow from login -> upload/review resume -> find jobs was presented well and it guided me through the process smoothly.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 | The site is quite concise with its verbage throughout.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | Most of the time it was quite clear where I was, with the one exception that I mentioned above. After finishing the review of my resume, it took me to my profile, but it looked like I was still in the review process.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | The tab order is set up well and covers all of the relevant links.  |
| **TOTAL** | 19/21  |   |

### 2.3 Site 2: Monster

#### [Homepage](https://www.monster.com/)

![homepage](/assets/monster1.png)
Just like Indeed, I like how the site starts you off right away at the search page so that you can look without having an account if you'd like. However, the link for logging in was not labeled clearly (it is just the icon in the top right; I didn't initially realize that was where the login link was).

#### [Login](https://identity.monster.com/login?state=g6Fo2SBaUUlGbkpDRXVjZ3pIQzh6X1p3RnlOXzMzSGlsMTlMQqN0aWTZIHNFTzVSTXBfMWdwX2F5a2JTWUo1a1dKM1RDc0JTdV9vo2NpZNkgc0JudzcybTRPNkExYXh1T2dRcVAwRmg4bkg1enJEcmU&client=sBnw72m4O6A1axuOgQqP0Fh8nH5zrDre&protocol=oauth2&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monster.com%2Fprofile%2Fauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&audience=profiles-profile-app-service&scope=openid%20profile%20email%20offline_access&monsterProps=eyJsYW5ndWFnZVRhZyI6ImVuLVVTIiwicHJvbXB0TW9kZSI6IlNpZ25VcCJ9)

![login](/assets/monster2.png)
Once here though, the login page looks pretty good. Monster also has the options to sign in with existing services, and I opted to sign in with Google again here.

#### [Resume](https://www.monster.com/profile/onboarding/resume)

![resume](/assets/monster3.png)
After the EULA, I was again prompted to upload my resume, which I did.

#### [Confirm Resume](https://www.monster.com/profile/onboarding/base-info?skipped=2)

![confirm](/assets/monster4.png)
The prompts in this page seem a bit more intuitive than the ones Indeed had, and the page itself is well designed too.

#### [Profile](https://www.monster.com/profile/detail)

![profile](/assets/monster5.png)
The information on this page is presented concisely and it seems that the page has good use of whitespace and balance.

#### [Job Search Results](https://www.monster.com/jobs/search?q=Software+development+internship+summer+2021&where=)

![job search](/assets/monster6.png)
After returning to the main job search page and searching for a job, this page shows up. The first thing I noticed about this was that the browser's scroll wheel is not present, and that the two panels in the middle of the page are independently scrolling. This seems simple but it adds an impression that this site was well-made and thought out, which I appreciate.

![job selected](/assets/monster7.png)
After selecting a job, the information is displayed in the panel on the right. Again, I really like the feel of the independently scrolling panels here, and the information doesn't seem too cluttered either. The link to the external application was clearly displayed.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | Overall the site was quite intuitive, but I did have a bit of trouble finding the login at first. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | The process for this site was much quicker than the setup process for Indeed. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | Important information was displayed appropriately and it was always clear what I needed to be seeing. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | The steps were clear and easy to follow. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | The information was always displayed concisely and avoided unnecessary words. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | While I did not make use of all of the site's capabilities, I did not have any trouble navigating what I did do. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | The tab key does scroll through the links, but most of them are not highlighted so it is impossible to tell which one is selected. |
| **TOTAL** | 18/21 |  |

## Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

### Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Creating a new goal |
| Description / Steps | **1.** User navigates to the 'goals' tab. </br> **2.** User clicks the "+" button. </br> **3.** User enters the goal name, the measurement type, and a color or icon for the goal. </br> **4.** User selects which friends to share the goal with. </br> **5.** User selects a check-in frequency. </br> **6.** User selects "create goal."|
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | **1.** User has an Emotive account. </br> **2.** User is logged into the account. |
| Postconditions | **1.** A new goal has been added to the user account. </br> **2.** The friends that the goal was shared with are notified of its creation. |

### Step 3.2 Identify a competitive product

#### Daylio (a [mobile app](https://daylio.net/))

Daylio is primarily a mood-tracking app that lets users track simple goals as well. It is not exactly like Emotive will be, but it is still within the same market.

### Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | Set up your account, skip goal creation for now. | Follow the prompts upon first opening the app. |
| 2 | Create a goal. | stats > goals > create goal > prompts |
| 3 | Log the past 3 days' moods. | "+" > today/yesterday/other day > enter date and mood |
| 4 | Check your mood chart. | stats > mood chart |
| 5 | Check out your weekly report. | more > weekly reports |

### Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | Set up your account, skip goal creation for now. | The app seemed rather intuitive, walking him through the setup |
| 2 | Create a goal. | He went into the mood logging page at first and then backtracked and found it. |
| 3 | Log the past 3 days' moods. | Since he had found the button before, he knew where to go for this. |
| 4 | Check your mood chart. | He found the mood chart immediately. |
| 5 | Check out your weekly report. | He scrolled down in 'stats' first, then 'calendar', before finding it in 'more'. |

### Step 3.5 Findings

1. Improvements
   - It should be made clearer what the big "+" button refers to.
   - Certain items like the weekly report seem like they would fit in the 'stats' tab, but are not there, so items should be reorganized into appropriate categories.
   - Creating a goal seems like an important thing users would want to do, so it should be more front-and-center in the UI.
2. Beneficial experiences
   - The participant stumbled across the solution to step #3 when looking for the goal creation page in step #2, so he knew exactly where to go when he did get to step #3.
3. Things we did well
   - We were clear on what the tasks were and let the participant find the solution himself, which led to a more genuine result.
4. Where we could improve
   - We could have spent more time familiarizing ourselves with the Daylio app before coming up with the UI testplan. This will be improved significantly when we write testplans for Emotive, since we will have full knowledge of the actions users can take within the app and what we are interested in testing for.
5. Overall experience
   - Ultimately this was a good experience and helped us get a grasp on what a UI/UX testplan should look like and how to carry it out. We were able to get a feel for the useability of the Daylio app and see how users would try to navigate it (both when we were exploring it to develop the testplan and when we observed the participant navigating it for himself). A lot of the comments the participant made were similar to what we experienced while exploring the app for ourselves.

## 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)

### Conventions are your friend

In application design there is often a desire to stand out from the crowd. This should be done for certain reasons and through certain channels (stylistic choices, fonts, among many others). However, there are certain conventions like having the navigation around the top and left sides of the window, having profile links in the top right, and letting users return to the homepage by clicking the company logo. These types of conventions should be encouraged and cultivated to maximize the users' intuitions for how the application works.
