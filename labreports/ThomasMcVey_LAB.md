# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | Score 1 | Summary 1 |

## 2.2 LinkedIn
https://www.linkedin.com
Step 1. Logging in.

![alt text](/images/L2.png)
My home page. The combination of the search bar and navigation icons placed at hte top makes it easy to navigate the site.

Here on the skill page, you can easily add and manage what skills are presented on your profile.

Step 3. Search for job.

The search bar brings up auto-complete suggestions.
<br>Step 4. Sort through prosepective jobs.
![alt text](/images/L7.png)
I like how the info appears right next to the highlighted job.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | Finding jobs and updating info is easy to do, but the amount of edit icons can cause the user to not know which one needs to be used to do what if they are unfamiliar with the website  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |   3| The home page of the user's account has all the major elements for either changing profile information, or searching for jobs. Little to no delay was experienced in searching for a job.   |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2.5  | Again, the amount of edit icons is much, but one can clearly tell that they are edit icons and with a bit of practice are no longer a problem.   |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | When creating an account, the site presents a progress bar showcasing how "complete" your account is. Furthermore it regularly notifies you of new jobs that match your specifications on a regular basis.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  |  The website is not overly verbose, nor do I see a need to add more or have less.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | The search bar for jobs is easy to see, and the returned jobs from the search are numerous and easy to read through thanks to good use of the space provided to the right.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0  | While not impossible to navigate, using tab to cycle through everything without being able to choose is tedious, and due to how visually reliant the site seems to be, I imagine that too would be a hassle.  |
| **TOTAL** | 16.5  | I believe it's a good site for finding jobs, and the intial creation of your account walks you through filling out important information. Furthermore, there is an additional system after initial creation to help finalize it.  |

## 2.3 Glassdoor

Step 1. Making my account.

Step 2. Importing LinkedIn info.
It would be nice if there was some way to know what would be imported from the options before going through with them.
![alt text](/images/GlassDoor2.png)
Step 3. Reviewing Imported info.

![alt text](/images/GlassDoor5.png)
Step 4. Job searching.
![alt text](/images/GlassDoor6.png)
Clicking on TE Connectivity brings a whole new page on glass door. Personally, I expected it to show up to the right since there's so much space there.
![alt text](/images/GlassDoor7.png)
After clicking on Apply now, it brings me to their website
where one needs to make an account, and then apply for the position.
![alt text](/images/GlassDoor8.png)
Here one can fill out their information to apply.
| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  1.5 | The search bar and icons speak for themselves in terms of what they are meant for. Importation of LinkedIn was easy to do, but how it got interpreted is not clearly explained. Furthermore, as a new user I did not understand why search filters were grayed out after I searched.|
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | While having the ability to import information from another site seems beneficial at first, having to correct anything that gets imported wrong wastes user's time. Besides that, the only thing that would specifically take an arduous amount of time would be filling out one's profile, but that is a given when creating an account.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  2 |  I would say the least clear aspect of the site would be the inital account creation options. As a new user who used LinkedIn, I had no idea how uploading my profile would be like, but chose it as it seemed to be the recommended option (the LinkedIn option is in color, and listed first). If I had known it could interpret my profile wrong, I would have chosen either the manual or Resume upload option. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | There are various hints and tips displayed on one's profile to help with augmenting your profile. These, used in conjunction with the easy to search for jobs makes it seem sufficient to me.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3 | Very image and symbol heavy, the majority of the text is to help users manage their profile or in the actual contents of the job pages.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  3 | Searching for jobs only requires you to type in the name, and if there are no results then it will still add suggestions relatively close to what you would want.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 0  |  Due to how visual this website is, I would think it to be an absolute nightmare to try to navigate while relying on a screen reader. Assuming one who is using a screen reader is either blind or has poor eyesight, they would need to rely on it to know what the site says, but wouldn't help in actually interacting with the site. Truly mouseless is also quite difficult as it seemingly requires the use of tab, without being able to backtrack. |
| **TOTAL** |  14.5 | I had heard from some friends that they didn't like Glassdoor, which is why I went with it for my option I didn't like, but overall it seems pretty solid as an option. Additionally, I mentioned Glassdoor to my father provided some feedback as he had used it before. As a professor, he found that searching for salaries on Glassdoor can prove frustrating when searching for the salary of a specific job, as the results can be far too diverse with few options to actually limit it to what you want. |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case| |
|---|---|
| Title | Finding the Campus Map|
| Description / Steps | 1.Open app<br>2. User login is Authenticated <br>3. Find and click on map|
| Primary Actor | Messiah University Student|
| Preconditions | 1. User must be a student.<br> 2. User must have the app.<br> 3. User must have an account.|
| Postconditions | System brings up map for as long as you use it, as well as allowing the user to return to the home page at the user's whim.|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. FalconLink [https://falconlink.webapps.messiah.edu](https://falconlink.webapps.messiah.edu)
2. Messiah Campus Tour Map [https://tour.messiah.edu/campus-map/](https://tour.messiah.edu/campus-map/)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Opening Messiah's website. |   |
| 2 | Find the campus map using the search bar or home screen. | |
| 3 | Successfully bring up the campus map.  |   |


## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Opening Messiah's Website | Found it easily enough.  |
| 2 | Find the campus map using the search bar or   |Campus map button is buried near the bottom of the page and the search bar is a single small icon near the top and hard to see, causing the actor to have to search for a bit until he finally found the search bar. Furthermore, there are 100+ links on the home page alone, causing the site to be cluttered and hard to find what one is looking for. (Reid's perspective)|
| 3 |  Successfully bring up the campus map. | Wanted to see student's thoughts on locations. Hated the art style. Didn't like how the map shifted from real to drawn, found it distracting. (Thomas' perspective)|


## Step 3.5 Findings
While the user was able to find the map in the end. The overall experience was frustrating. This was due to the user not initially knowing the locations of neither the search icon in the top right, nor the campus map button on the bottom. Finding the icon was likely made more difficult due to the vast amount of other links and icons present on the initial page. User did not think to scroll to the bottom of the page where the map button is located. Upon locating the search bar, the user quickly found the map. <br><br>
(Note: This user account is technically the culmination of three separate individuals. Team members Reid, Thomas, and Tim all followed the process to find the map and Messiah's website, and this account is a merger of the three. Tim on the other hand seemingly found the map button but not the search icon.)
