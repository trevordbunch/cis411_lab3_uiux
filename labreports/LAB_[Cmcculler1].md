## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Linkedin | 20| Linkedin is very easy to use and the user interface is very simple and they do not waste your time with extra questions and surveys. |
| Handshake | 16| Handshake was better than I anticipated. The issue for me was the fact that they had extra surveys and questions multiple times which could be a waist of time. |

# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Church Searching|
| Description / Steps | User creates account, then searches for churches near them.|
| Primary Actor | User|
| Preconditions | User must be logged into the application with an account|
| Postconditions | Some form of output must be produced|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [Yelp.com](www.yelp.com)


## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 |  Change the location to your hometown |   |
| 2 | Leave a review on a resturant   |   |
| 3 | Search for a Christian Church  |   |



## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Change Location to hometown  |  Task was simple, location was able to be changed on home page |
| 2 |  Leave a review on a resturant |  User had to chose resturant, click "write a review", user must be signed in to post review |
| 3 |  Search for a Christian Church |  Searched "Christian Church" in search bar... asks for location |


## Step 3.5 Findings
- One improvement that can be made to the location section is being able to insert multiple locations for a search. Another improvement is there could be a filter to use for different types of churches. Also a "write a review" tab on the main page so you do not have to go through another link.
- Two benefits of the workflow is the search bar and the use current location option. 
- I think the usability test covers multiple different aspects of the workflow.
- Team could find tasks that are not as simple next time for a usability test.
- Conducting a usability test is not as easy as it seems. It is difficult to use the right tasks to test the worflow. Sometimes I feel like it will be a lot easier than other times.
