# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 16 | Pretty good UI/UX. I personally find it to be cluttered, but it's not frustrating to use. LinkedIn's mobile experience is excellent. |
| Handshake | 17 | Handshake possesses a UI/UX that should bring little frustration to their users (except on their mobile site). |

## 2.2 Site 1
![Navigating to profile.](/assets/LinkedIn1.png)
*(Above): If I want to navigate to my preexisting profile, I click on my little PFP, then click on "View Profile."*

![Adding skill (1).](/assets/LinkedIn2.png)
![Adding skill (1).](/assets/LinkedIn3.png)
![Adding skill (1).](/assets/LinkedIn4.png)
*(Above 3): Once navigating to my profile, I scroll down to my skills box and click on the pencil. Then, I click on the "+" on the page that opens. Next, I type in the skill I want to add (which LinkedIn can autofill), and then click "Save" to add it.*

![Finding a job.](/assets/LinkedIn5.png)
*(Above): To find a job, you click on "Jobs." Without even needing to input any search criteria, LinkedIn has generated a list of jobs based on selections I made when making my profile. Some of those selections are shown towards the bottom of the above image.*

![Applying for job (1).](/assets/LinkedIn6.png)
![Applying for job (2).](/assets/LinkedIn7.png)
![Applying for job (3).](/assets/LinkedIn8.png)
*(Above 3): After finding a job that I liked, I clicked on the "Apply" button. That took me to a new page where if I pressed its "Apply Now" button, it took me towards the bottom of the page where I can apply for the job with LinkedIn.*

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | LinkedIn is intuitive, but each page tends to throw a lot of information at the user at once. You're able to find your way to the places that interest most LinkedIn users (your profile and jobs, for instance), but it takes a minute to find other resources through all of the information. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Despite the clutter, you're still able to find the most important places of LinkedIn quickly. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | As stated above, the important places of LinkedIn are easy to find (jobs and your profile). Other information will take some time to find via scrolling. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 1 | I would say that LinkedIn doesn't lead users down any sort of path. It lets users choose what they want to do rather than guiding them towards certain things. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | The buttons are short and sweet. LinkedIn is very "wordy," but they draw the user towards information that may interest them through the use of small graphics. This can be seen in the fifth photo I included in this section with a bright green symbol next to "Actively recruiting." |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | LinkedIn flows enough. It's not a flow that's found the first few times of using the site, though; I remember being a little lost when I first started to use LinkedIn. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | VERY good mobile version. I could tell that LinkedIn took the time to create a good mobile experience (nice and neat, information I would be most interested in while using my phone is readily available, etc.). |
| **TOTAL** | 16 |   |

## 2.3 Site 2
![Navigating to profile.](/assets/Handshake1.png)
*(Above): If I want to navigate to my preexisting profile, I click on my little PFP, then click on "My Profile."*

![Adding skill.](/assets/Handshake2.png)
*(Above): Once navigating to my profile, I scroll down to my skills box, type in the skill I want to add, then click "Add."*

![Finding a job.](/assets/Handshake3.png)
*(Above): To find a job, you click on "Jobs." You can further filter the kind of job you want using the buttons next to the search bar.*

![Applying for job (1).](/assets/Handshake4.png)
![Applying for job (2).](/assets/Handshake5.png)
*(Above 2): To apply for a job, I click on the "Apply Externally" button. For this job, I just need to submit my resume. Afterwards, I proceed with the application by pressing the "Step 2: External Application" button.*

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2 | Navigating to my profile was pretty intuitive since many sites, this one included, have you go to the top right of the page in order to get to your profile. Also, looking for jobs isn't too complicated since it's right there in the header on every page. My only complaints are finding the skills and "Apply" buttons: both need some scrolling to get to them. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Even though there are some navigation points I'm going to be a stickler about, it doesn't take too long to find what you want. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3 | The most important steps (e.g., "Apply") are clearly marked, typically by possessing a certain coloration that makes it stand out on the site. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | When looking for a job, Handshake takes your eyes from the header (where "Jobs" is), down to where to search and filter jobs, and then down to where the results will show. You scan down from the top down to the bottom half where your interests are. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 2 | Handshake was good about shortening things down to a few words, though I will gripe about the "Step 2: External Application" button. I didn't find an indicator of there being any sort of step 1, so I feel that the button could have just read "Apply Externally." |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | As demonstrated in category 4, Handshake follows a natural top-to-bottom flow. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 1 | Using Handshake on my phone was not an accessible experience. Some parts of the site translated okay, but the entire site was too big, so when I would try to scroll down the site, it would sometimes misalign and scroll off to the side. |
| **TOTAL** | 17 |  |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case 1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Finding a location |
| Description | This use case describes how a user would find a location |
| Steps | <ol><li>Hiker logs into account</li><li>Hiker will navigate to community map</li><li>Hiker will search for locations</li><li>Hiker will select their desired location</li></ol> |
| Primary Actor | Hiker |
| Preconditions | <ol><li>Hiker would have an account</li><li>Application already has locations</li><li>Hiker has access to Internet</li></ol> |
| Postconditions | Application displays results relevant to search |

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors
1. Competitor 1 [https://www.alltrails.com/](www.alltrails.com)
2. Competitor 2 [https://www.gaiagps.com/](www.gaiagps.com)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Search for a trail by city (user's). | The user will navigate to the main screen and search for a trail by the city they live in. |
| 2 | Sign into account | The user will click the "Log In" button from the main screen. |
| 3 | Navigate to AllTrails shop | From the main screen, the user will click on "Shop." |
| 4 | Search trails by "easy" | User will click on "Explore," and then under "Difficulty" select "Easy." |

## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Search for a trail by city (user's) | User used search bar on homepage, then clicked on "Trails" |
| 2 | Sign into account | User immediately found "Log In" button. I had her pretend to enter credentials like she had an account. |
| 3 | Navigate to AllTrails shop | User first scrolled down to find the shop, and then found "Shop" button at the top of the page in the navigation. |
| 4 | Search trails by "easy" | User performed the same actions as she did for step one and realized that she could not filter by difficulty that way. Spent some time scrolling through the main page. Searched "easy carlisle" on the main page's search bar. I eventually told her where to go. |

## Step 3.5 Findings
<ul>
<li>3 Improvements</li>
<ul>
<li>The AllTrails shop should be more obvious for users given that my sister could not find right away.</li>
<li>Being able to navigate to the more detailed search should also be more obvious given that my sister could not find it either.</li>
<li>Some of the options from the more detailed search should also be included in the search bar in the main page, especially since users are highly likely to search using that first over the more detailed search.</li>
</ul>
<li>2 Benefits</li>
<ul>
<li>The location of "Log In" button matched where it is on many sites.</li>
<li>AllTrails provided a way for users to quickly search trails on the homepage.</li>
</ul>
<li>The team created a usability test that could also be used to test our application.</li>
<li>The team could come up with more steps that could be tested. What we had was fine, but we could have gone into more detail with other actions.</li>
<li>I made sure to carefully observe my sister as she navigated the site and take notes on what she did. Conducting a usability test helped me to see the value in observing a user going about their business on a site. I had initially thought that I could get away with doing that myself with my own applications. However, since I made the application, I'm very familiar with it. It behooves having a sibling to rope into being your user in a usability test.</li>
</ul>

# 4. Your UX Rule (Extra Credit)
Abigail Garrido's very own pithy usability rule: :sparkles: *Aestheticism* :sparkles:

Your "billboard" can be the most organized "billboard" in the world, but it also needs to be pleasing to the eye. It's good to have someone around that knows their way with colors and shapes so that the site subject and site design match each other, which will project an air of profressionalism. Also, color matters **a lot** in regards to accessibility. You might be able to see the text, but some users are colorblind or have trouble reading text in certain colors or fonts. Both should be kept in mind when adding in those CSS elements; everything should be aesthetically pleasing and aim to be aesthetically pleasing to *everyone*.
