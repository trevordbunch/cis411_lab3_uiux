## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Ziprecruiter | 17/21 | ziprecruiter was the first site that i looked over since it has become one of the primary sites used by employers to find potential candidates. It was intuitive but it did have some issues in certain parts of the site. The good thing was that it did not take very long to fillout. The important steps were clear, but there were details left out that would have been helpfull. The design was good and allowed for the information to be understood. I would not that there were parts that i felt i needed to guess a bit as to what they wanted. The accessiblity was there which allowed for people with disabilities to use the site.   |
| Indeed | 21/21 | I was rather impressed by the site indeed. It did not make people second guess themselves and gave clear instructutions overall. It valued the users time by being very concise and straight to the point. It had good billboard design that supported it's information. It did clearly state what it wanted people to do and allowed them to find exactly the information they needed. It did have accessiblity which allowed disabled people to use the site readily. |

| 1 | Go to Instagram.com   | She was able to got the site right off the bat since she knew exactly where to go.|
| 2 |  Click Signup. | She clicked signup right away. |

| 11 | End at personalized home page. | She finished the signup process but thought it took a bit too long.|


## Step 3.5 Findings
Overall it went rather well, She was able to go through the motions quite well and the site appeared very natural to her. She did mention that it was similar to a lot of other sites. I believe that this might have infulenced her, since a lot of the information that was required of her was similar to what would be required in other sites. She seemed to find the sight quite intuitive and did not have much issue overall. It seems that she was annoyed over the extra measure of having to leave the site in order to complete the email confirmation. Although this is similar to other sites it seems that she doesn't like that.

The three things that could be improved about the workflow are as follows, inegrating the use of other existing accounts into the creation of an instagram account. Allow for more ease of communication through the use of different languages in the registration process for people who are fluent in other languages. Less requirements for registration.

The two expierences that i found benefited the user was the use of contacts in finding friends. Allowing her to connect with popular accounts that may be within ther interests.

My team did a good job of working together and coming up with a concise usability test that was straight to the point and was very clear. We could improve uppon it by adding more complexity to the usability and coming up with more conditions for it's use. I found it interesting doing the usability tests because i've never done it before. Since i had the technical knowledge to back up what i was testing i felt like i was appart of the process more.

# Extra Credit
A rule that i would create, would be that whatever information is on the page needs to be balanced and supported by the rest of the page.
It can't just be a random part but needs to add to the rest of the page and balance out visually with the rest of the page. If it's too random then it'll throw off the user when they stumble uppon it on the site. If it's not balanced with the rest of the page then it'll literally throw off the rest of the page and make the page look visually disjointed.
