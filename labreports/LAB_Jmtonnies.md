- [✓] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [✓] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Glassdoor | 18 | Although Glassdoor had a very nice job searching portion of the page I felt that Glassdoor did not value my time at all |
| ZipRecruiter | 19 | ZipRecruiter seemed very thought-out and honestly valued my time much more than Glassdoor. Overall I felt that Ziprecruiter was working for me and  Glassdoor was employing me. |

## 2.2 Glassdoor

![Glassdoor Signup](/assets/Glassdoorsignup.png)

- This is the landing page for Glassdoor. As you can see there was an ease to signing up as you could signup through Google or Facebook I personally chose Google. It was a one-click signup.

![Glassdoor After Signup](/assets/Glassdoorafter.png)

- After signing up Glassdoor asked questions about what I was looking for.

![Glassdoor Questions](/assets/GlassdoorQuestionspng.png)

- What I did not like was the questions that went on like in this screen shot where they were digging into my current job. If I wanted to upload that information I will do that at a later time. Do not ask me this in the signup process.

![Glassdoor Skills](/assets/Glassdoorskills.png)

- Glassdoor has a very nice skills section that actually just read my resume and automatically filled in the information which was very nice.

![Glassdoor Jobs](/assets/GlassdoorJobs.png)

- I really liked the process of searching for a job on Glassdoor. It was nice because they gave you the job description but also gave you a toolbar that left the other job opportunities on the screen.

| **TOTAL** |  18 |   |

## 2.3 ZipRecruiter

![Zip Creation](/assets/ZipCreate.png)

- When signing up for ZipRecruiter it was interesting because they asked you for your interests before an email or name which is not normal but in my opinion a good touch

![Zip Page](/assets/Zippage.png)

- After only a few questions and uploading my resume ZipRecruiter made this page with all of my skills including everything that was on my resume

![Zip Skills](/assets/Zipskills.png)

- The skills portion of the main page was very easy to navigate

![Zip Jobs](/assets/ZipJobs.png)
 
 -The job searching portion of ZipRecruiter was interesting. Instead of focusing on only only job it showed you many different opportunities and made the one the you were focusing on slightly bigger.

2. Competitor 2 [Facebook Groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups)

## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Navigate to Meetup.com  | Is it easy to navigate to?  |
| 2 | Find Account creation tools  | Can they find it on their own?  |
| 3 | Fill in all fields correctly  | N/A  |
| 4 | Verify that you have made an account  | There are different ways of doing this (Logging in / checking email) |

User: Alecclyde

| Step | Tasks | Observations |

| 2 |  Find Account creation tools  | There was no hesitation as Alec found the sign-up button in the top right of the page  |
| 3 |  Fill in all fields correctly |  The site guided him through the process very easily and there was no question of what was to be filled in |
| 4 |  Verify that you have made an account |  Alec wne through the process of logging-in to find that indeed his account was created |
| 5 | Sign-out and log-in to Meetup  |  Alec found the sign-out and sign-in buttons very easily and was back to his account in no time |

## Step 3.5 Findings
- Pros
    - The explicit walking through of the sign up process
    - The ability to sign-up through different platforms like Google
- Cons
    - There was no option to sign-in through Twitter
    - Meetup never asked for the users Preferences
    - There was no recommended groups in the area
- Group Pros
    - We did a good job talking through the way we were navigating through the site.
- Group Cons
    - We need to navigate a site that we have never been on before. Alec was familiar with Meetup so it was not a true out of the blue usability test.
- My Experience
    - I feel like it was actually fun conducting these usability tests as I get to see how other people go about using a site. To me it is important to know other ways someone may look at a website.
